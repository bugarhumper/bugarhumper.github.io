			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">As we talk about pelvic organ prolapse, we simplify things by always viewing it as either a descent defect or a herniation defect. Therefore, we will teach you one descent defect (uterine prolapse) and two herniation defects (cystocele and rectocele). We keep the lesson confined to those three subjects in order to facilitate mastery of the concepts underlying all pelvic organ prolapse.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The prototypical <span class="Bold">descent defect </span>is <span class="Bold">uterine prolapse</span>. The <span class="Bold">uterosacral ligaments </span>and <span class="Bold">pelvic floor muscles </span>keep the uterus suspended above the bladder and prevent it from falling downward. Youth and estrogen keep those ligaments and muscles strong. The loss of estrogen at menopause weakens the uterosacral ligaments and pelvic floor muscles. With age, the effects of gravity take their cumulative toll on those same ligaments, having strained them for life. Aging induces atrophy of all skeletal muscle, including the pelvic floor muscles. Finally, <span class="Bold">pregnancy</span> (regardless of how the fetus is delivered) creates a heavier, larger uterus while simultaneously deforming and stretching ligaments. The stretch of the ligaments and the subsequently increased weight on the pelvic floor leads to the descent of the uterus.</p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The prototypical <span class="Bold">herniation defects </span>are <span class="Bold">cystocele </span>and <span class="Bold">rectocele</span>. The posterior vaginal wall is in contact with the connective tissue between the vagina and the rectum, typically referred to as the rectovaginal fascia within the rectovaginal space. Just as in the abdomen, if there is a muscular defect in the posterior vaginal wall, a hernia sac can protrude through that defect. The epithelium and submucosa of the vagina are intact, and the vagina is distensible, so the herniating bowel does not penetrate into the vagina but stretches the vaginal mucosa, bulging the mucosa-and-submucosa-covered bowel into the vaginal lumen. This is visualized as a <span class="Bold">posterior vaginal wall defect </span>and is often presumed to be a <span class="Bold">rectocele</span> (the bulge presumed to be the rectum). The anterior vaginal wall is in contact with the connective tissue between the vagina and bladder, typically referred to as the vesicovaginal fascia within the vesicovaginal space. If the anterior vaginal wall fails, the bladder (cystocele) or urethra (urethrocele) can herniate through the defect. This is visualized as an <span class="Bold">anterior vaginal wall defect </span>and is often presumed to be a <span class="Bold">cystocele</span>. Herniation is how we get <span class="Bold">cystocele </span>and <span class="Bold">rectocele</span>. </p>

			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Risk Factors for Pelvic Organ Prolapse</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Age </span>is one of the highest risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse, and the <span class="Bold">peak incidence </span>of symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse is in the eighth decade of life (age 70–79). The infirmities of age seem to contribute more than the cumulative stresses of gravity, although pelvic organ prolapse tends to worsen over time (i.e., gravity has an effect).<span class="Bold"> Increased intra-abdominal pressure </span>pushes down on the pelvic floor from above, stretching the uterosacral ligaments. Women with COPD or chronic constipation (straining) or those who did or do lots of heavy lifting are at increased risk. Once pelvic organ prolapse has already occurred, intra-abdominal pressure exacerbates the severity. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Connective tissue </span>is implicated. Women with defects in extracellular matrix proteins (Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) have an extremely high rate of prolapse and usually experience greater severity and earlier onset than women without connective tissue disorders. This supports the theory that mild, innocuous damage to a ligament or fascia forces the other structures to carry more of the weight, causing them to stretch and fail over time. In women with connective tissue disease, that failure occurs at an accelerated rate. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Estrogen </span>definitely plays a role. The amount of smooth muscle in the uterosacral ligaments decreases in the absence of estrogen, and estrogen therapies improve prolapse symptoms. The causal mechanism behind estrogen use has not been elucidated, but it is known to work. Estrogenization of the local tissue likely restores the smooth muscle and provides bulk by restoring the atrophic mucosa. Local estrogen therapy is enough, but women on hormone-replacement therapy at menopause (see Gynecology: Reproductive Endocrinology: <span class="Hyperlink-Italic">Menopause</span>) experience less pelvic organ prolapse.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Pregnancy causes severe changes in the size and shape of the uterus, resulting in pulling and stretching of the uterosacral ligaments and transverse cervical ligaments. Therefore, because we have polarized the underlying mechanisms, we want you to associate the <span class="Bold">number of pregnancies</span> with an increased risk of <span class="Bold">descent defects</span>.<span class="Bold"> </span>In addition, because a relatively large organism passes through the birth canal during vaginal delivery, the vagina is stretched and distended the most it ever will be in a woman’s life, potentially weakening the vaginal wall or tearing it from its connective tissue attachments. Therefore, because we have polarized the underlying mechanisms, we want you to associate the <span class="Bold">number of fetuses delivered vaginally </span>(twins count as two vaginal deliveries but only one pregnancy) with <span class="Bold">herniation defects</span>—<span class="Bold">cystocele </span>and <span class="Bold">rectocele</span>.</p>
			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Symptoms of Pelvic Organ Prolapse</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">As mentioned above, pelvic organ prolapse is often entirely asymptomatic. But symptomatic cases can greatly interfere with quality of life. All forms of pelvic organ prolapse can cause <span class="Bold">pelvic pressure</span> or pain, can cause <span class="Bold">dyspareunia </span>(pain during sex), and will present with some sort of <span class="Bold">bulge into the vagina</span>. We want you to think in terms of the three diagnoses, so we’re going to characterize the symptoms of each. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">A <span class="Bold">rectocele </span>may cause <span class="Bold">defecatory</span> symptoms, especially constipation. The herniated bowel behaves similarly to an abdominal hernia—the bowel either kinks in the herniated segment or becomes incarcerated by the vaginal muscle through which the bowel has herniated. The prolapse into the vagina (as long as it is not incarcerated) can be reduced via digital manipulation—inserting fingers into the vagina, pressing on the defect—thereby temporarily relieving the relative obstruction. Rectocele is a posterior wall defect and so will demonstrate a bulge into the vagina from the posterior wall, which is inferior during a speculum exam. A <span class="Bold">bulge from below </span>on a speculum exam indicates a posterior wall defect, likely a rectocele. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">A <span class="Bold">cystocele </span>may cause <span class="Bold">urinary symptoms</span>. The dangerous consequence of cystocele could be complete urinary obstruction, although this presentation is rare. A complete urinary obstruction will cause a distended bladder (which hurts), the inability to void, and even evidence of acute kidney injury from the backpressure if not attended to. More common is partial urinary obstruction, presenting similarly to BPH in men—<span class="Bold">frequency</span>, <span class="Bold">urgency</span>, difficulty starting the urinary stream, and <span class="Bold">incomplete voiding</span>. Cystocele is an anterior wall defect and so will demonstrate a bulge into the vagina from the anterior wall, which is superior during a speculum exam. A <span class="Bold">bulge from above </span>on a speculum exam indicates an anterior wall defect, likely a cystocele. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Uterine prolapse </span>will not come with urinary or defecatory symptoms. Instead, because the cervix leads the descent, and penile contact with the cervix is often painful, <span class="Bold">dyspareunia </span>is typically the predominant symptom. Because uterine prolapse results in the descent of the cervix, a speculum exam will reveal a cervix that is too close to the vaginal introitus. </p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">During a vaginal exam, pelvic organ prolapse is measured on the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification scale (“POP-Q”) and staged as 0–4. A “hands-off” assessment is preferred, the patient doing a Valsalva maneuver in an attempt to demonstrate the extent of the prolapse. The examiner will see either vaginal mucosa bulging downward (a sign of herniation defects) or the cervix bulging downward (uterine prolapse). We will not show you the mechanism of measuring the six planes of the POP-Q, but the interpretation of the staging is simple, and you should be familiar with it. </p>

			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Treatment</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Prolapse is not dangerous (with one caveat at the end of this section), so treatment is based on the patient’s degree of symptoms. In the absence of symptoms, pelvic organ prolapse is managed expectantly—do nothing. However, when patients complain of bothersome symptoms, there is a spectrum of possible treatments, from conservative measures (e.g., pelvic floor muscle training, estrogen) to pessaries and even surgery. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Topical estrogen </span>can safely be used to correct vaginal atrophy (thickens and lubricates the mucosa), restore ligament strength, and provide additional support for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. It comes as a cream, gel, or vaginal ring. Because it is topical and not systemic, there is no increased risk for endometrial carcinoma, breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis, or atherosclerotic disease like there is when starting systemic estrogen therapy long after menopause. Remember that the older the patient is, the more likely she is to have symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, and starting systemic estrogen more than 10 years after menopause is harmful (increases the risk of cardiovascular disease; see Gynecology: Reproductive Endocrinology: <span class="Hyperlink-Italic">Menopause</span>). </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Pelvic floor muscle training</span>, colloquially called Kegel exercises, strengthens the skeletal muscle of the pelvic floor. This increases the muscular support of the pelvic organs and reduces the need for surgery.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Pessaries</span> are prosthetic vaginal devices designed to provide mechanical support to the pelvic organs. They either fill up space, preventing prolapse, or lift the apex of the vagina. Often, multiple sizes and shapes are tried during a fitting appointment with a gynecologist in order to find the ideal balance between support and comfort. Although pessaries are designed to stay in place, patients must follow up with their gynecologists (usually every 3–6 months) for removal and cleaning of the pessary and inspection of the vaginal walls. Some patients are able to perform pessary hygiene at home and present to the office less frequently for examination. Regardless of the follow-up interval decided upon based on the patient’s (or her caregiver’s) participation in her pessary care, the importance of follow-up cannot be overemphasized. Neglected pessaries can lead to <span class="Bold">erosion</span> and <span class="Bold">ulceration</span> of the vaginal walls, and in severe cases, can lead to impaction of the pessary and even the formation of fistulas to adjacent organs, even in areas that were not previous prolapsing.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse can be categorized as either obliterative or reconstructive.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Obliterative surgery</span> (called colpocleisis) essentially closes the vaginal space. The mucosa is surgically removed, and the bare ends of the submucosa are sutured closed. This eliminates the vaginal lumen entirely. Obliterative surgery is offered to elderly women who may be poor candidates for more extensive procedures due to medical comorbidities and who have no desire for future sexual activity involving the vagina. Hysterectomy is indicated with obliterative surgeries but is not required, although cancer must be ruled out first if the uterus is to stay in place. Obliterative surgery is a last resort. </p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Most patients are treated with reconstructive surgeries, which aim to restore pelvic anatomy. Most reconstructive procedures are approached <span class="Bold">transvaginally</span>, although some are performed laparoscopically. The techniques, strategies, and approaches are numerous and are not something you need to know at this level of training. And remember, we’ve simplified the problem to either descent issues (which warrant resuspension) and herniation issues (which warrant surgical closure, sort of). Prolapse of the bladder or urethra (anterior wall herniation) is repaired by <span class="Bold">anterior colporrhaphy</span>, and prolapse of the rectum (posterior wall herniation) is repaired by <span class="Bold">posterior colporrhaphy</span>. In these procedures, there is a laxity of the connective tissue and vaginal wall through which the organs are herniating. An incision is made through the vaginal wall to expose the connective tissue between the vagina and the organ, with the area of defect identified by the region that is doing the bulging. The vaginal wall is reflected, the vesicovaginal fascia is tightened with sutures, the vaginal walls are dissected to a length that corrects the laxity, and then the vaginal wall is sutured closed. These procedures reinforce the connective tissue layers between the vagina and the prolapsing organs. </p>

Mesh procedures treated herniation syndromes in lieu of colporrhaphy, essentially treating vaginal hernias the same way general surgeons treat abdominal hernias. Until recently, surgical mesh was frequently used in reconstructive vaginal surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse. However, these procedures were associated with significant risks, including mesh erosion of the vaginal wall, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. Additionally, they were not found to be more efficacious than other reconstructive surgeries to treat prolapse. In 2019, the FDA ordered manufacturers to stop selling surgical mesh devices intended for this purpose. Of note, this FDA order did not extend to mesh used in abdominal sacral colpopexy, and it also did not include mesh used for incontinence surgery (mid-urethral slings). These surgical mesh devices have much better safety profiles than the mesh used for transvaginal prolapse repair, and their efficacy has been extensively demonstrated. </p>
			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">When Prolapse Can Be Dangerous</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Prolapse can be dangerous is if the patient is unable to empty her bladder (urinary retention). This occurs because the urethra gets kinked when the vagina completely everts, making it difficult to pass urine, and straining will only force the bulge out further, making it harder to empty the bladder. Sometimes elderly women will present to the ED with urinary retention due to prolapse, in which case she is taught to intermittently self-catheterize or an indwelling catheter is placed until she can be seen by a urogynecologist (indwelling catheter may often be the choice in real life because of the convenience, but it is always the wrong answer on a licensing exam because it increases the risk for infection).</p>
