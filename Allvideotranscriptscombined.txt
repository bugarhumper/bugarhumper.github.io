NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Bias]  
﻿This video is about bias. Bias is anything that affects the outcome of your study that is not what you're to test. There are tons of sources of bias. I'm just going to cover the ones that come up on tests most frequently. If you want a more comprehensive list, take a look at the notes. All right. Let's break this down, based on some sources of bias. Research subjects or study participants are one source. Researchers themselves are another sources, and then there are some biases that are just inherent in doing research, these we'll say come from the study. All right. Bias that comes from subjects. First one that you need to know is Hawthorne effect. Now, in Hawthorne effect people change their behavior because they know that they're being observed. So, observation leads to behavior change. The next one that you need to know is a recall bias. In recall bias, the way that I want you to remember this is that sick patients remember more. So, this happens in retrospective studies, where you have a group of sick patients and a group of healthy people, and you ask them to think back to exposures in their past, and people who are sick are going to think just a little bit harder about exposures that they might have had, out of an eagerness to explain their illness. And the way that you address bias that comes from subjects is with blinding, that's where you don't let them know what group they've been assigned to, and when only the subjects are blinded that is referred to as single blinding. All right. So, biased that comes from the researcher, is a much bigger deal, but fortunately it is also easier to address. The first one here that you need to know about is selection bias. In that selection bias, at baseline the groups that you're comparing are different from each other in a way that they shouldn't be. So for example, if I'm a researcher and I put all of my sickest patients into the group receiving the study drug and all of my healthier patients into the group receiving the placebo. I can't really make a fair comparison at the end of the trial. So that selection bias. You can think of it as, groups are different at baseline, and the way that you address this is with randomization, that is you don't let the researcher pick who goes into what group. You do a coin flip or a random number generator, so that it's based on just random chance, not based on what I want as the researcher. You can't always do randomization, and another tool that you can use to address that is matching. So that's where for every person in the study group you get somebody who is similar to them, who matches them in terms of demographics, and you group them for the comparison group, and the way that you show that you're matching and your randomizations have been successful, is you show that they have similar demographics, and you compare these in a table. All right. Next one you need to know about is observer bias. In observer bias, the researcher knows what group everyone has been assigned to. They know who is getting the placebo and who is getting the study drug, and their knowledge of this impacts the way that they evaluate everybody, consciously or unconsciously. So researcher evaluates, differently, and the way that you address this is you don't let them know what group people are in. You blind them and when both the researcher and the subject have been blinded, this is double blinding. All right. So let's move on to sources of bias that come from just doing research itself. Next one I want to talk about is confounding. Confounding is the most important topic in this whole video, if you learn nothing else, learn confounding. All right. So, what confounding is, is when you have an exposure, and you have some outcome and you see that they are related, so you think, hey, the exposure must be causing the outcome, but you are wrong, because there is a third factor that you did not think about, that is related to both the exposure and to the outcome, and that third factor is distorting the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Let's talk through an example. Bizarrely enough, ice cream consumption is associated with an increase in drowning deaths. So, I might be tempted to say, hey, ice cream consumption causes drowning, but I'm wrong, because I did think about summer. Summer causes ice cream consumption. Summer also causes drowning deaths, and when I count for this fact, the relationship between the exposure and the outcome disappears. That's confounding. Ways that you address this, you can do -- you can do a good study design, or you can do randomization, you can do matching, either one works. Do not confuse this with effect modification. So, effect modification technically is not a bias. So, I'm going to put it in little parentheses here. We need to discuss it here though, because it gets confused with confounding so easily. Let me show you why. Just like with confounding, we have our exposure, and we have our outcomes, and we think that they're related, and there's even a third factor here, and the third factor is associated with the outcome. The difference here, is that the third factor is not related to the exposure, and this is key. The third factor enhances the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Let's talk through an example. Oral contraceptive pill, OCPs are associated with a small increase in the risk of DBTs. If you look a little bit closer, you see that it is not just the OCPs that is causing the increase in DBTs. It is oral contraceptive, OCPS, and smoking together that causes the big increase in DBTs. Smoking is not really related to OCPs, but when you add smoking to oral contraception, you have a modification, an enhancement of the effect, and that is the key difference here, when you add the third factor, you get a stronger effect. Okay. So, just to do a quick recap, when you have bias that comes from subjects, you want to blind. When you have bias that comes from the researcher, you want to blind again. Double blind. You also can use randomization and matching, and do not confuse, confounding and effect modification. Remember that in confounding, your third factor negates the relationship between your exposure and your outcome, and in effect modification, your third factor enhances the relationship, and that is bias.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Confidence Interval]  
﻿This video is about confidence intervals. If you haven't done this already, I highly recommend that you watch my video on hypothesis testing, and my video on risk before proceeding. Okay. So, let's talk about what happens when you do a study. When you do a study, you have population that you're hoping to make generalizations about. So, this is the whole population, and you collect data from a group of people, this is the sample, and from your sample you calculate a mean, and the mean that you calculate from your sample is a guess. You hope that it is representative of the rest of the greater population that you're trying to generalize about, but you can't be sure unless you give yourself some wiggle room, and the way that you do that is with a confidence interval. Confidence interval, makes you more likely to contain the actual population value that you are trying to make a guess at. Okay. So, now let's think back to the hypothesis testing video. Remember in the hypothesis testing video what we were trying to get at was significance. Was there a statistically significant group -- uh, difference between the two groups, and so the way that we did that, was we were comparing two means, and if our P value, which we calculated from our data, if our P value was less than alpha -- alpha the predetermined cut off for what is statically significant. P was less than alpha, we had reached significance, and if P was greater than alpha, we had not reached statistical significance. So, in order to make a more accurate comparison, the thing that we should do is incorporate our wiggle room. We need to include our confidence intervals. What that would look like, is say means plus wiggle room. So, comparing our two means with a 95 percent confidence interval is equivalent to using a cut off of alpha of .05. 95 percent confidence interval, the same thing, alpha .05. So, now instead of comparing P to alpha, what we're going to check is whether or not our two confidence intervals overlap. So, if we have a confidence interval that looks like this, and another one that looks like this, we have overlap, and when you're comparing two confidence intervals, overlap means that there's not a statistically significant difference between the two groups. You have overlap. So you have no statistical significance. Overlap is bad, it means that your groups are the same. If instead, your confidence intervals are really narrow, and you have no overlap, you have reached statistical significance, because there is no overlap between the two groups that means that your groups are different. All right. So, how do you get skinny narrow little confidence intervals? The way that you do that is with power. Increased power means narrower confidence intervals, it means you are more likely to reach statistical significance, and how do you get a higher power? You get a larger sample size. So you include more people in your study. All right. So, that is how you interpret a confidence interval when you are comparing two means. You get two confidence intervals and you don't want them to overlap. You are actually more likely to get tested on the interpretation of confidence intervals for odds ratios and relative risk, and remember from my odds ratio and relative risk video, that when you have an odds ratio or relative risk greater than one, that means that you have a positive association between your risk factor and your disease outcome, and if you have an odds ratio or relative risk that is equal to one, that means that there is no association, and if you have one that is less than one, that means that there is a negative association, and remember, this is for odds ratio, or relative risk. All right, and so for this, what you want to remember is that you do not want your confidence interval to cross one. So, this is one here, this is zero, it's two, and on, and on. Here's the line that we do not want the confidence interval to cross. So, if you have a confidence interval that is greater than one, and it doesn't include one at all, then you're in good shape. You still have an association between your risk factor and your outcome. If you have one, if you have a confidence interval that is less than one, but still doesn't cross one. Again, you're still in good shape, there still is an association between your risk factor and your outcome. If instead, you have a confidence interval that does cross one, you're in bad shape. There is no association between your risk factor and your outcome. Okay. So to recap, confidence interval, is just wiggle room to make sure that your guess includes the true population value, and when you're comparing two means, you do not want your confidence intervals to overlap one another if you're trying to show that you're groups are different, and in odds ratio and relative risk. You want to make sure that your confidence interval does not cross over one, if you're trying to show that there is a relationship between your risk factor and your outcome, and that is confidence intervals.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Diagnostic Tests]  
﻿Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value are measures of how good a diagnostic test is. There are also really frequently tested concepts, so you need to be comfortable calculating and interpreting them. Your best friend for this is a two by two table. Now, in a two by two table, disease status is always at the top, always. With positive on the left and negative on the right, and the test result will be on the side. Positive on top, negative on the bottom. All right. So, in the disease positive column, these people have the disease no matter what. Regardless, of what their test results says we know that they have the disease. So, if they have a positive test result, if that test is correct, that is a true positive test result. TP for true positive, and if they get a negative test result, that's not correct, that test is wrong, because we know that they have the disease. So this is a false negative. Similarly, for people who do not have the disease, that's the disease negative column. If they get a positive test result, even though they don't have the disease, the test is wrong. This is a false positive test result, and if they get a negative test, that test is correct, because they don't have the disease. So this is a true negative test result. All right. We are going to use these to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Let me just write these down. I'm going to write sensitivity down here at the bottom of the positive disease column. Specificity over here by negative diseases, positive test result gets positive predictive value, and negative test result gets negative predictive value, and when we calculate these four equations, what I want you to remember is that true is going to go on the top, and sum is going to go on the bottom. True on top, sum on the bottom. Let me show you -- let me show you what I mean. We'll start with sensitivity. Sensitivity, like I mentioned, is at the bottom of the positive disease column. So we're only looking at people who have the disease and within this column, true goes on top. So the true value here is true positive. That's going to be our numerator. True on top, true positive. Our denominator is the sum. Sum goes on the bottom. That's true positive and false negative. Sensitive tests frequently get used as screening tests. This is because they rarely miss the disease, and in fact, a test that is perfectly sensitive will never miss the disease. Unfortunately, sensitivity doesn't tell us anything about the rate of false positives, and also unfortunately, a lot of really sensitive tests have high rates of false positives. So, an example here would be Pap smears screening for cervical cancer, and if you have a positive Pap smear that means that cervical cancer is a possibility. That said, lots and lots of women have positive Pap smears and then when you do colposcopy, they end up not having cervical cancer. These are false positive test results. This is where specificity is helpful. So, specificity, remember, we are looking at the disease negative column. We're looking at people who do not have the disease, and remember again, true is going to go on the top, and the sum is going to go on the bottom, and so true within this column, is true negative, and our sum is true negative, plus false positive. Specific test frequently get used to confirm a diagnosis after you have a positive screening test, and this is because specific tests give very few false positives, and in fact, a test that is perfectly specific will never give a false positive. So, if a good example of a sensitive test is Pap smear, then a good example of a specific test would be colposcopy. So, to recap, sensitive tests are good because they don't miss the disease, and specific tests are good, because they don't give false positives. Now, there is a pneumonic that gets used frequently, that I find pretty confusing, but it gets used all the time. So, we're just going to go over it really quickly, that's spin and snout. So, let's start with snout. So for snout, you write SN for a sensitive test, SN -- SN, and then you write N again for negative. So given a highly sensitive test, if negative rules out the disease. So think again of the Pap smear, if you have a Pap smear that is negative, you can be pretty confident that you can rule out cervical cancer. Likewise -- likewise for spin, SP for specificity, you write another P for positive. So given a highly specific test, if it's positive rules in the disease. Thinking back to the colposcopy example, if you have a positive colposcopy, a positive specific test, you should probably be pretty concerned about cervical cancer. All right. Let's move on to positive predictive value. Positive predictive value is at the end of the test positive row. So we're only looking at people who have tested positive. Remembering, that true is going to go on top, the true value here is true positive, and the sum, is going to be true positive and false positive. So, how I like to think of positive predictive value, is it's what your patient is going to want to know if they get a positive test result. So, if I'm your patient, and I get a positive test result, if I show up in your office. I'm going to want to know given my positive test result, how likely is it that I actually have the disease, and another thing that you should know about positive predictive value. This is just one of those weird things that shows up on tests all the time for some reason. It's that with increasing disease prevalence. You get higher positive predictive value, and I just remember this because there are lots of Ps, all the Ps are going in the same direction. High prevalence, high positive predictive value. Okay. Let's move on to negative predictive value. Negative predictive value is here at the end of the negative test result row, and remember that true goes on the top, so our true within this row, it's true negative, and our denominator is the sum, false negative and true negative, and similar to what positive predictive value is, it's if you get a negative test result, you want to know how likely is that you actually are disease free. All right. Let's finish with the word on precision and accuracy. Precision in a diagnostic test requires that you are able to reproduce your results, and that your results are consistent. So, if I am an archer, and I go to the archery range, and I'm shooting at a bull's eye, and if all of my arrows kind of go pretty close together, around the same exact spot, really, really tight distribution, but none of them hit the bull's eye. I'm precise, but I'm not accurate. Precision, it does not require that your test measures what it intends to measure. It just measures that you can repeat it really, really consistently. However, with accuracy, your test needs to measure what it says that it's measuring. So, this would be, if I went to the archery range and I was getting a lot of arrows in the bull's eye, but not necessarily all in the bull's eye. In fact, they can be pretty spread out, and it will still be called accurate. As long as it's centered on the bull's eye, and I'm getting them in the bull's eye, that's considered accurate, it's just not precise, because I'm not reproducing my results really well. So, this is accurate. Now, ideally you have a test that is both precise and accurate, and that would look like this, where you get a nice tight distribution, all in the bull's eye. This is both precise and accurate. So, that's precision and accuracy. Let's just summarize really quickly the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. Just remember, that these are really important concepts, and you definitely need to be really comfortable of reproducing this table. Do not forget the disease status goes on top. Test result, goes on the side, and the positives, go in the top left corner. You should also remember, that sensitivity is going to be referring to people who have a disease, and specificity, is going to be referring to people who do not happen disease. Likewise, positive predictive value, refers to people who have a positive test result, and negative predictive value, refers to people who have a negative test result, and finally, when you are deriving all of these formulas, remember, true goes on the top, and the sum goes on the bottom, and that's it for diagnostic tests.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Hypothesis Testing]  
﻿This video is about hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is an important tool in medical research and it's also a fair game for your boards. So in medical research we're often trying to compare two groups. For example, say I want to study a new blood pressure medicine. One way that I could do this would be to get a group of people and give them the study drug and get another group of people and give them a placebo, and then compare the average blood pressure between the two groups. So the question that I'm asking is, is group one equal to group two or are they different? So these comparisons can be a little bit tricky, because sometimes groups are different just by luck of the draw, so just due to random chance I might pick a group of people for group one who has a lower average blood pressure than the people in group two. The question in statistics then becomes, if there is a difference between the two groups, is that just due to random chance? And so the way that we go about addressing this is with hypothesis testing. We're going to start with a hypothesis that most researchers secretly hope to be true, which is that group one does not equal group two. Researchers want this, because they usually want to show that there is a difference between the groups. They want to show that the people who got the study drug have a different outcome, have better blood pressure than the people who did not. So the way that we test this is with another statement that we hope to prove false, which is that group one equals group two. They are the same, they have the same outcome, and this is referred to as the null hypothesis, which is written with a big H and a little subscript zero. You can think of the zero as being for zero difference between the two groups, and this, the first statement, the one that researchers are usually secretly hoping for, this is the alternative hypothesis. This is what we want and this is what we test, and something that I want you to notice is that these two statements are mutually exclusive, that means if one of them is true the other one is false, they cannot both be true. Now that we have our null hypothesis, we need to decide whether or not we think that it's true. If we think that it is not true that is called rejecting the null hypothesis, and the way that we decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis is with something called a P value, and P value is calculated using our data. So we plug our data into some statistical software and outcomes the P value, and if the P value is small, that means that we get to reject the null hypothesis. We're betting that this is not true, we're betting that this is true, that there is a difference between the two groups. So when P is small we get to reject the null. If instead, P is large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We're stuck with it. We have to say that the groups are not different. So a smaller is better for P values, if you're trying to show that groups are different. So how do we decide what counts as small? The way that we do this is with something called Alpha, which is the significance level, and by convention and biomedical research this is set to 0. 5. This means that we are willing to accept up to a five percent chance that the difference between the two groups is due to chance alone. So we're willing to accept up to a five percent chance that the difference that we observed between the two groups is not due to the study drug, but actually due to just random chance. So alpha is the cutoff level where we decide whether P is small or large. If P is less than alpha if it is smaller than 0. 5 that means that we get to reject the null, and if P is greater than alpha, that means we failed to reject. So when P like I said is less than alpha, that means that we have reached statistical significance. This is what people are going for when they do research, and the way that this is denoted sometimes is with little stars, so we'll give this P a star. Researchers are always running around trying to get the smallest P possible. Remember that a smaller P is better if you're trying to show that there's a difference between groups, and if you're having a hard time getting that to stick in your head, remember that in statistics a small P makes a big difference. Okay. So -- so far we've been talking about rejecting the null or failing to reject the null based on our data. We calculate P and we compare it to the preset alpha and we're trying to make a decision. We're making a guess and this is a little bit weird to think about, but since we've been making a guess that means it's possible that were wrong. We could be guessing that the groups are the same when the reality is that they're different or vice versa, and if we're guessing wrong or making an error. There are two types of error that you need to know about, let's just talk about them with a table. On the top of our table, we'll talk about the truth about than null hypothesis. So the null hypothesis -- the null hypothesis can either be true or it can be false. This is the reality, this is what we don't necessarily know, this is what we're guessing at. So on the side, we're going to put our guess, and the guess that we make is based on our hypothesis testing. So if we do our hypothesis testing we get a large P, we fail to reject the null, and what that means is that we are guessing that the null is true, T for True, and if we get instead a small P and we reject the null hypothesis, what we are doing is we are guessing that the null is false. Okay. So let's start in the universe where the null hypothesis is in reality true. Regardless of what our data actually tell us. The null hypothesis is true. There actually is no difference between them. If we use our data to guess that the knoll is true, we're correct, we made the right decision. If instead we guess that the null hypothesis is false, still in the universe where the null hypothesis is in reality true, we've made an error. This is called Type 1 Error. Type 1 Error is rejecting the null hypothesis even though it's true. The probability of committing this type of error is equal to alpha. It's actually the same alpha that's here. So if this is alpha, the probability of this is one minus the alpha. All right. Let's move on to the universe where regardless of what our data end up telling us, the null hypothesis is false. There actually is a difference between the two groups. If within this universe where the null hypothesis false. We make a guess that the null hypothesis is true. We have again committed error. We've committed a Type 2 Error, and the probability of committing a Type 2 Error is equal to beta. All right, and if in this reality where the null hypothesis is false, we guess that the null hypothesis is false, we're correct again, and that this is equal to one minus beta, and this actually has a name. This one minus beta or the probability of guessing that the null is false, when it actually is false, and this is referred to as statistical power. Power is a good thing, we want it to be high. It's actually an indicator of the likelihood that we're going to make the right decision here. So the thing that I want you to remember about power is that it increases with larger sample sizes. So a bigger study with more people means greater statistical power. All right. So to recap, hypothesis testing is how we decide whether or not two groups are different and we do that by comparing a P value which we calculate from our data to alpha. If P is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis, and if it is larger than alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If we reject -- if we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true, we have committed a Type 1 Error and if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, when it was actually false we have committed a Type 2 Error, and finally power increases with increasing sample size, and that is hypothesis testing.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Prevention]  
﻿When you think of prevention, what you usually think of is never getting the disease in the first place, but actually it's a little bit more convoluted than that, and I want to go over some vocabulary, and then solidify it so that you know what type of intervention is what type of prevention. You'll see what I mean in a minute. There's three degrees of prevention, primary prevention is what you think of as the lay term of prevention, that is you prevent the onset of disease. We're going to use an example of hypertension here through this and then we'll get into more details at the end. The idea here, is that a normal patient may progress to having hypertension. Primary prevention, would intervene to keep the person normal. That is they never develop hypertension in the first place. Secondary prevention, is all about detection. They have the disease, what you want to do is delay progression. That is the person who has hypertension will be prevented from developing the sequela of myocardial infarction. Tertiary prevention, is not prevention at all. This is preventing the complications that arise of that's a sequela. In this case, the myocardial infarction would lead to CHF. Now, it can become a little convoluted, about which one is which, but there are some things that come up a lot, that are going to then help you label which one it is, and if you just memorize it and try to figure it out. You can get some points on the test. In life, you're just going to do these things, it doesn't matter what you call them you're going to do them all, but as it comes the testing you might find yourself caught trying to pick primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary prevention is what you want to do. Primary prevention is all about reducing exposure. You know a certain exposures cause diseases, we generally call them risk factors. The goal here is to reduce exposure in the first place. Examples of primary prevention are going to be things like, weight loss, smoking cessation, reduce alcohol intake, and eating better. Now, eating better isn't meant to be intentionally vague, because this is a touchy subject, but of course, more leafy greens, more vegetables, more organic stuff better than fast food and processed foods. Primary prevention may also be in the form of a therapy though. Right, so primary prevention may include vaccination. The idea is, that we either prevent any problem from coming if they get exposed or we reduce the exposure overall. Secondary prevention, is more about screening and early intervention. Screening and intervention is going to be achieved with screening tests, and to be a good screening test, you generally want to be sensitive. That is will tolerate false positives, so that we don't miss false negatives, and when we identify a disease early, we intervene generally in the form of lifestyle modifications, of course, but often medications. To use a concrete example, diabetics who are diagnosed with an A1C of 7.1 are put on oral medications and asked to exercise. Their A1C may fall to non-diabetic levels. You got a diabetic diagnosed with an A1C of 14, and you need to put them on multi-daily injections of subcutaneous insulin. They're likely to get worse. So secondary prevention is about finding disease early through screening tests, and intervening before they become a problem. Tertiary prevention is about treatment of disease. This is going to be achieved through lifestyle modifications, but usually that is not enough. So tertiary prevention is almost never a lifestyle, at this point it is going to be through treatments, and is generally considered more responsive than preventive, and here I'm talking about neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Aspirins, statin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor for coronary artery disease, after the stents been placed with clopidogrel. Tertiary prevention, is what you do when you treat disease. Secondary prevention is figuring out that they have it in the first place and trying to get rid of it. Primary prevention, is reducing the exposure so they never develop it in the first place, and to get on my soapbox a little bit here, primary prevention costs very little. It's usually just talking to somebody doesn't involve anything, except maybe a vaccine. Secondary prevention costs a little bit more, that screening colonoscopy or the fact that you end up treating someone with stage one hypertension, but the big deal is tertiary prevention active therapy is the most costly. Chemotherapy for drugs, frequent bouts to the hospital. The idea being that, those who are in tertiary prevention are the ones we're going to cost the most, and the reason in our country, that 99% of our healthcare dollars goes towards one percent of the population, is because that one percent is here. They have severe disease, they're barely hanging on, and we're giving all the therapy we can to keep them alive. Whereas, those people who were healthy and stay healthy don't cost anything. That's prevention. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Risk]  
﻿This video is about risk. Risk is a measure of incidence of disease. We're going to be focusing on odds ratio and relative risk, which explore the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and development of a disease. The first thing that we need to do though is talk about probability versus odds. Those terms get used interchangeably in everyday life, but they actually mean something slightly different. Let's talk through an example. One out of every 10 people in the US is left-handed. So if we want to calculate the probability of being left-handed, the way that we do that is by comparing the number of events to events plus non-events, and what we mean here by events is the number of people who have the thing that we're interested in. The number of left-handed people and if it's one out of every 10 people the number of events then would be one, there's one event, and then the number of events again would be one and then the number of non-events would be the number of people who are right-handed. So it'd be nine. So probability of being left-handed is one for events, over one for events, plus nine for none-vents, compare that to odds. To calculate the odds of being left-handed, I would compare the number of events to the number of non-events. So one for events, because there's one left-handed person, and then nine for non-events, because they're nine right handed people. Something that you should know about probability and odds is that they approximate one another when you are looking at a rare disease, and that is because the number of healthy people or the number of non-events is really high, so these numbers would both be high, but the number of events, the number of people who have the disease, this would be really low. So basically you end up looking at just the number of events to the number of non-events when this number is really small. So let me repeat, odds and probability approximate each other with rare diseases. Okay. So that's the difference between probability and odds. I know they're really similar, but they're going to be used differently in odds ratios and relative risk. Let's start by using a table to understand the difference between odds ratio and relative risk. So, we're going to do a two by two table that's going to look pretty familiar. There will be disease status on top whether or not somebody has the disease with positive in the top left corner and negative on the right, and on the side will be exposure status, whether or not somebody has been exposed to a disease. Positive on the top, negative on the bottom. If this looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen something really similar when looking at sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, and so far they are identical except for exposure status is on the side whereas in the other one, the test result is on the side. All right. Now to fill these in, you have A and B, and the disease or in the exposure positive row. A and B in the first row, C and D in the exposure negative row, in the row people who have not been exposed, A, B, C, D. Remember to always put this table together the same way with disease status on top, exposure on the side, A and B in the first row, and C and D in the second row. Okay. So let's use these to talk about odds ratio and relative risk, finally. So when you do a cohort study, what you do is you get a group of people who have been exposed to a risk factor, you get another group of people who have not been exposed to a risk factor, and you follow them over time to see who develops the disease, and in order to make that comparison you use something called relative risk, which I'm going to abbreviate RR. So relative risk gets used for cohort studies. So what this is looking at is the probability of getting the disease in people who have been exposed over the probability of disease in people who have not been exposed, and we're using probability here, so we're going to be using events over events plus non-events to calculate what goes next. So, let's start with the numerator here. We need to find the probability of disease in people who have been exposed. So we're only looking at people who have been exposed, we're only going to be looking at A and B because this is the population of people who have been exposed. So we need to find what are the events and one of the non-events here. So the events would be who has the disease. So A is the events. A over everybody who's been exposed, A and B, events and non-events. A plus B. So just to repeat the probability of people of getting the disease in people who have been exposed is A over A plus B. Now we're going to look at the probability of disease in people who have not been exposed, so we're only looking at C and D. This row of people who have not been exposed, and we're going to find that the number -- we're going to find the events, and the events here again is the people who have the disease, so it's going to be C, and then that means that the non-events is D. So it'll be C over C plus D. This is relative risk. Compare that to odds ratios, which I'll abbreviate OR, which are used for case control studies. In a case control study, you start with a group of people who have the disease that you're interested in, and then you also get a group of people who are -- who do not have the disease that you're interested in and you look back and you ask them, were you exposed to this risk factor? And then you compare between the two, and like I said the way that you make this comparison is with odds ratio. So the way that you calculate odds ratio is unsurprisingly using odds rather than probability. So you find the odds of a positive exposure in people who have the disease over the odds of having the exposure and people who do not have the disease. All right, and so what is -- how do we calculate the odds of exposure in people who have the disease. We need to look first at people who have the disease, so we're going to be looking at this column, and here we need to again find what is the event and what is the non-event, but we want to know who was exposed. So positive exposure is our event and negative exposure is our non-event. So the odds of exposure and people who have the disease would be A over C that is our numerator A over C. Events over non-events, and then the odds that exposure in people who do not have the disease, we need to look in the disease negative column, and that's B and D, and so which one is the event here? The event here again would be positive exposure, because that's what we're interested in. So it would be B for events over D for non-events. B over D. We have A over C, over B over D, and then this simplifies to A, D, over B, C. That's odds ratio. Okay. So let's talk about how you interpret these. The interpretation for odds ratio and relative risk for our purposes is essentially the same. You're trying to figure out what is the relationship between the exposure and the disease. Does the disease come from being exposed? So if you have an odds ratio or relative risk that is greater than one, what that means is there's a positive association between being exposed to something and getting the disease. So there's a positive association. An example might be smoking as your exposure and COPD as your disease status. People who smoke are more likely to get the COPD. If your odds ratio or your relative risk is equal to one that means that there is no association between exposure, and the outcome, and the exposure and the disease. So, an example if we still are using smoking would be, smoking and say getting a bunion. As far as we know, there's no relationship between somebody smoking and then getting a bunion. So we would expect one to be our answer. So if you then get an odds ratio or relative risk less than one that means that there's a negative association. That means that, if you're exposed to the risk factor you are less likely to get the disease, and if we're still using smoking, our example could be smoking and ulcerative colitis. For some reason, smoking is protective against the development of ulcerative colitis. So there is a negative association. All right, and that's the interpretation. The next thing that we need to talk about is, the number needed to treat a number needed to harm. Number needed to treat, is the number of people that you need to expose to some sort of treatment in order for one person to benefit. Ideally every person that you give treatment to would get some benefit from it, but in reality that's not how things actually work. Usually you need to give a lot of people warfarin in order to prevent one stroke. That's similar to number needed to harm. Number needed to harm is how many people do you need to expose to some sort of a risk factor in order for one person to be harmed by it? So how many people need to be taking warfarin, in order for one person to experience an adverse bleeding event? Now the way that you calculate this, is a little bit interesting. The number needed to treat is equal to one over ARR, and that stands for absolute risk reduction, and number needed to harm is equal to one over AR, which is attributable risk. ARR and AR, honestly are not that important, they just don't come up on test that much. We're going to go over, how you calculate them, but only because you need them in order to get to number needed to treat and number needed to harm, which are the more important things that we're talking about. So let me just make a box around this so you remember, number needed to treat a number needed to harm are the important things to remember. Okay. So, to calculate absolute risk reduction, ARR. What you do is you take C over C plus D, which is the probability of having the disease in people who have been exposed, minus A over A plus B, which is the probability of disease in people who have been exposed. Just to note, this is the same thing as this, and this is the same thing as this. If that helps you remember, great. If not, don't worry about it, and attributable risk, AR is just flipped. So then, it would be A over A plus B, minus the C over C plus D. I'm going to go over one more thing really quickly, it's relative risk reduction RRR, but this is just equal to one minus relative risk. That's really all you need to know about for relative risk reduction. All right. So to review, make sure that you know the difference between probability and odds, and definitely, make sure that you can recreate this table exactly with disease status on top, and exposure on the side, positive in the top left corner, A, B, C, D. Always the same. Make sure that you can remember how to calculate relative risk, and remember that it goes with cohort studies, make sure you can calculate odds ratio, and remember that it goes with case control, and remember how to interpret. Specifically remember, that if you have an odds ratio relative risk equal to one, there is no association, and that is risk. Become a better doctor.

[Epidemiology and Stats - Screening]  
﻿When we screen people, what we're trying to do is capture disease under the bell curve. Population statistics is about finding out what's good for society. That is, we don't want to do too much, but we want to be able to catch enough disease to help a bunch of people. So what we've come up with are screening guidelines based on studies we've done that tell us these things are good to do, because by doing them more people benefit and less people get harmed. You of course have to consider the number needed to treat, that is, how many times do you have to do this for someone to benefit versus the number needed to harm, how many times you need to do this for a complication, and then compare how bad the complications are relative to the perceived benefit. You don't have to do any of that. In this lecture let's just talk about what you do to screen, know what diseases, how to do it, and when to start. Two things, cancer and medical disease. Let's start off with cancers first. Cancer, when you start screening, how you screen, and when you stop. The most important cancer for the test is colon cancer, and you want to start screening for colon cancer at age 50 or 10 years before the first diagnosis. That is if your father got diagnosed with colon cancer at 42, you should be screened 32, age 50 or 10 years before the first diagnosis in a primary relative whichever one comes sooner. The reason why I put colon cancer at the top is because the way you screen is the most complicated, and any of these count, but if you change the number of frequency of year, you can make a right answer wrong or a wrong answer sound right. The best thing that you can do for colon cancer screening is a complete colonoscopy, and that is done every 10 years, but you can also do a flex sig every five years with fecal occult blood testing every three years, or you could do a fecal occult blood testing every year. Now you can see how they can see these words and then change the years and really screw you up. So as you remember this, colon is ten, flex is five with an FOBT three, FOBT one. Ten, five, three, one. It's in descending order. All of these are fine, and I use FOBT, fecal occult blood test to mean anyway of examining the stool for microscopic blood. You're going to hear about the FIT. For you, it is essentially the same as fecal occult blood testing. It doesn't matter which one you do, they are the same. You're going to continue colon cancer screening until 75, but there's pretty good evidence you should continue past 75, but for certain people. The idea is it takes about 10 years to develop from a polyp into cancer, which is why the colonoscopy is 10 years and you start 10 years from the first diagnosis. If you're going to live more than 10 years, you should probably have colon cancer screening continued. So definitely do colonoscopies until 75 and until 85 if they're really healthy. After that, don't put them through any unnecessary test. The next big cancer is breast, and the way we screen for breast cancer has changed a little bit, and you may still see people prescribing the old way of doing it. The test, that way is wrong even though some societies still recommend it, we are going to use the new recommendation. The old recommendation was to begin at 40 and screen every year. This is no longer the case. What we do -- do now is 50, begin age 50 and then screen every two years with mammography. The idea is something like this, if you do 40 Q1 [phonetics] you will catch more breast cancer, and that person that you found positive before age 50 may benefit, but this is about populations and statistics is about population level and cost-conscious care. Your patient in front of you may have a cancer and you don't diagnose it, but the problem is that the number of patients that need to receive that 40 Q1 actually harms more women than it helps. Women were going through lumpectomies and biopsies leading to abscess and lymphedema such that a false positive rate was too high causing too much morbidity. So 40 Q1 does catch more cancer, but isn't worth it at a statistics level, the population level. 50 Q2 balances, catching women with breast cancer, but reducing the morbidity associated with false positives. You continue until age 75. The other female cancer we screen for is cervical. The right answer is to start cervical cancer screening at age 21. The age at which you began having sex is absolutely irrelevant. Again, population under the bell curve. If you have a high-risk patient, like someone who has had AIDS since they were born and are now sexually active at 11, you might want to screen her for cervical cancer, but again, what likely happens in the general population is that even those girls who are exposed early on in adolescence clear the virus and don't have an increased risk. Therefore, the age of onset doesn't matter. Age 21, the way you screen is with a Pap every three years, and you continue doing Pap smears until either she's age 65 and has three consecutively normal Paps, or she had her cervix cut out, total abdominal hysterectomy. Now, there is another option that you can use for old women. I want you to learn 21 Q3. If you -- if you take a woman who is slightly older, you can do pap Q5 with HPV testing Q5. I don't want you to learn that, because it becomes more complicated and it's actually hard to read in the board intentionally. I want you to learn 21 Q3, but know in the back your head that there's this other option, and if you do HPV testing you can kind of delay them a little bit. That's more for women comfort rather than cervical cancer screening. The last cancer we screen for, that's right we only have four. The last cancer we screen for is lung cancer, and the people we screen for lung cancer are those between the ages of 55 and 80, and they have a 30-pack year history, and they quit less than 15 years ago, and that is including those who are still smoking. The way you screen for lung cancer is a low dose CT scan, and you do that every year. You do that until they're either age 80 or the time that they quit is more than 15 years ago. Note that doing an x-ray does not help with lung cancer. So you should not do them for screening. If you're going to screen someone for cancer, low dose CT. Now, I also want to point out some of the cancers that we do not screen for. Some you might be looking for them. We do not screen for prostate cancer. We used to do digital rectal exams plus screening PSAs, and some cancer society still recommend doing this especially for those who are high-risk, those who have someone who in their family who had prostate cancer. You should learn, do not screen. The reason why we don't do this anymore is the lead time bias. This is the same timeline of exactly the same person. Here they are now. They are going to die at exactly the same time. Their fate is fixed. What happens when we screen someone for prostate cancer is that we find prostate cancer, and so they live all this time with prostate cancer. If we didn't screen for them, they're still going to die the same time. We find that prostate cancer very close to their death, and so it looks like we've prolonged life. You've reduced mortality. This is the lead time. It turns out you die with prostate cancer, not from. Are there patients who will die from prostate cancer, of course, but at a population level it isn't worth it, because you put so many men through unnecessary procedures and biopsies leading to erectile dysfunction and incontinence that it's not worth it. The right answer is discuss with your patient whether or not they should, but really, what they're saying is don't screen for prostate cancer. The other thing to not screen for is ovarian cancer. We tried a lot of things. Serum markers and CA125, imaging with transvaginal ultrasound, and it turns out what happens is you get disease in very late stage, and it doesn't matter that you screen, because they're going to die anyway from their advanced disease. So don't screen ovarian cancer unless they're BRCA positive. More than that on the general surgery breast lecture. That's cancer, colon, breast, cervical, lung. Colon is 50 Q10, breast 50 Q2, cervical 21 Q3, lung cancer 55 to 80 who have smoked 30-pack years and quit less than 15, CTQ1. Let's change gears and go over medical disease. In the medical disease, you want to know what disease we're talking about, who you screen, and how you screen. There are three one-time diseases that you are going to see on your test, not maybe all three of them, but at least one. The first is the male disease and that's abdominal aortic aneurysm. You are going to screen those men who are greater than 65 and who have ever smoked. It's men and over 65 and who have ever smoked, unlike lung cancer, the pack here isn't considered. The way you screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm is with an ultrasound of the abdomen, but if the person has already had abdominal imaging, CT scan of the abdomen for example, for another reason, that counts. One-time screen after 65, look for the aneurysm. Its counterpart in women it is osteoporosis. You're going to screen women who are over the age of 65 and it's all women, and you're going to do that with a DEXA scan. You're testing their bone mineral density. If you have a negative score, what you're looking to do is treat her for osteoporosis with bisphosphonates. You're going to have the option for vitamin D, vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D and calcium are prophylactic and should be done after menopause. Vitamin D, 50,000 units per week should be done if there's vitamin D deficiency, but if you find a positive DEXA scan that is she does have osteoporosis, treated with bisphosphonates. That's the right answer, and the one that's gained a lot of ground, men and women, is Hep C, and it's Hep C because we have a treatment for it. Anyone who is a baby boomer gets screened once. Now, it makes sense to me that you would do more than that. People use needle drugs, have HIV, but the USPSTF has a recommendation, the Hep C antibody is reserved for everyone who is born between the ages of 1945 and 1965. One-time screen. This next few are going to be just general health screening which is still useful, but these are the ones come up on the test most often. HIV, everybody gets a screen once, and you do it through an ELISA. If the ELISA is positive, you confirm before you tell them they have a HIV. It's everyone once and then any time someone wants one. It's called a risky behavior or engagement and risky activity. Really, it means that if someone comes in and requests an HIV test, you give it to them. If you think they might have HIV, you give it to them. If they're sexually active, they can get an HIV screen, screen for HIV, and then some of the cardiovascular diseases, which are very popular on testing, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Hypertension, everyone gets screened every visit. A blood pressure is taken as part of the vital signs and they're screening for hypertension. However, the diagnosis is made two consecutive blood pressures separated by two weeks, because there might be some element of anxiety, panic, rushing, or white coat hypertension, but the best way to diagnose hypertension is ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. That is the person goes home, takes their own blood pressure and writes it down on a piece of paper. That's because the person may have left work, skip a half today in order to go to the doctor, or rushed across town and is very excited and panic that they're late and would be made to wait 30 minutes in the waiting room and finally get their blood pressure. Or white coat hypertension where they come to the clinic, they get anxious their blood pressure goes up. Doing it at home at the same time on multiple days is a better way to diagnose hypertension, and diabetes is surprising, because you think the person who get screened for diabetes would be someone who looks like the type of person who might get it, but the USPTF says people who have hypertension should be screened for diabetes, not obesity, and you do so with an A1C. I want you to hear that the two-hour glucose tolerance test is a thing, but is largely been replaced by the A1C except in the setting of gestational diabetes, where the two-hour glucose tolerance test is a backup to the one and three-hour test. Diabetes, those who have hypertension, get an A1C. Dyslipidemia, now remember, as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, being 45 for a man or 55 for a woman. The numbers are different, but see that 10-degree difference. See why I emphasized 10-degree in a minute. It is said that those who should be screened for dyslipidemia are men greater than equal to 35 all comers or those who are greater than 20 with risk factors for coronary artery disease. See the 10 difference. In women, who are greater and equal to 45, 10 difference, 10 difference, or those greater than 20 with risk factors. This is implying that basically everybody who goes to the doctor is going to get screened for cholesterol, and the way you do that is with a lipid panel, and we know now that the main way to treat dyslipidemia is with statins, and you do everything you can to get them on a statin. To all the things you can do in clinic to help people, especially the elderly, are going to be things that most people miss. Right? So you do want to screen some people especially geriatric population for depression and for mobility. Now, don't worry so much about who, because these are the less strong recommendations, but things you can do are screen people for depression using the PHQ-9. What is that? Don't worry about it. Just know the PHQ-9. Screen them for depression, ask them the questions and see if they have any problems, and the other thing to do is mobility tester, get up and go. Do they have the balance and coordination necessary to pop out of a chair or should they be taking it a little bit slower and maybe need some walking assistance like a walker or cane. Cancer, colon, breast, cervical, lung. Medical disease, AAA, 65 men, osteoporosis, 65 women. Hep C, baby boomers. HIV, everyone. Hypertension, everyone every visit. Diabetes, those who have hypertension use the A1C and not the glucose tolerance test, and dyslipidemia they're going to be everybody, treat with statins. Don't forget about geriatric population or mood disorder and mobility disorders really creep up on them and cause a major impact on their life. That's screening. Become a better doctor.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Study Design]  
﻿There are a handful of different study designs that you need to be familiar with, but let's start with incidence and prevalence of disease. Incidence that looks at all the people who are newly diagnosed with the disease in a given period of time. It's typically a year. Compare that to prevalence which looks at all the people who have the disease right now. So if this is everybody, everybody who can possibly have the disease ever, everybody who's at risk and I want to look at how many people were diagnosed with diabetes this year, and it's this little segment right here. This is the incidence of diabetes. Since diabetes is a diagnosis that sticks around for a while, it's a chronic illness, the number of people who have the diagnosis at any given period of time is going to be greater than the number of people who were newly diagnosed. So if I wanted to look at the total number of people who have diabetes right now, it would include the people who were newly diagnosed and then a lot more. It would look like that. So that would be prevalence of diabetes. All right. On to the different kinds of studies. We can broadly break up study design based on whether or not there is an intervention. An intervention is anything that a researcher does to people in the study. It can be a new medicine, it can be a pamphlet, it can be an old treatment, whatever. It's just something that the researcher does or gives to the people in the study, and if there is no intervention, what you have is an observational study, and this can be broken down even further based on whether or not your observational study includes a comparison. If there is no comparison, if you're just describing something, you have a descriptive study and it's going to be one of two that you need to know about. You have either a case series or you have a cross sectional study. A case series is just what it sounds like, it's a series of cases. So this is something where somebody noticed a few interesting people who have a disease and they just wanted to describe it. You get, kind of, a -- you get qualitative information, not really any quantitative data, and it's presented as a narrative. So if a case series is where you just notice something, a cross-sectional study is where you start looking into a little bit more. You start asking questions. In a cross-sectional study, you ask a question of a group of people once at a single point in time. You can do this to assess prevalence. It's like taking a snapshot of traits of a group at that one moment. All right. On to observational studies that have a comparison group. We can break this down based on what are the groups that you're comparing. If you're comparing the same group of people repeatedly over time, what you have is a longitudinal study, and you can think of a longitudinal study as a series of cross-sectional studies. You send out a survey or something once to a group of people and you do it again, and you do it again at the next year, you do it again the next year. It's just a bunch of cross-sectional studies, and this is really useful for assessing change and prevalence. Okay. So for these next two, you have to actually start really paying attention, because the next two study designs that I'm going to talk about are the most important ones of the whole video. So if the groups that you're comparing are people who have the disease that you're looking at versus people who do not have the disease. So you're comparing based on disease status. What you have is a case control study, because cases are people who have the disease and controls are people who do not have the disease, and if you're comparing people based on exposure status, so whether or not they have been exposed to a risk factor. What you have is a cohort study. Now, both case control and cohort studies, they're both looking at the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and then the development of a disease. They're looking at this question from different angles. Let me explain a little bit. So the way that we like to think about disease is that there is some kind of an exposure. Maybe it's to a stressful home environment or it's air pollution, whatever. There's this exposure that happens and then later on you develop a disease. We like to think about with the exposure happening before the disease. In a cohort study, which is prospective. Prospective means looking forward, you start with the exposure. You find a group of people who have been exposed to something and then you follow them over time, and you ask, do they develop the disease? And all the while you've also been following people who have not been exposed so that you can compare them. So in a cohort study you are comparing two groups based on exposure status and for people who have been exposed to a risk factor and people who have not been exposed to a risk factor, which group ends up getting the disease more often, and you do this calculation using something called relative risk. You don't need to know too much more about what relative risk is right now, just try and remember that relative risk goes with cohort studies. I will explain a lot more about it in a later video. Okay. So an example of a cohort study might be something like finding a group of people who have chosen themselves to receive the flu vaccine, and finding a group of people who did not get the flu vaccine this year, and then we follow them throughout the flu season and compare among those two groups which group gets the flu more often. Compare that to a case control study. Case control studies are retrospective that means they look backwards. So the group that we use here for case control is disease status. We start here with disease. We find a group of people with the disease and we ask them, think back in your history, were you ever exposed to this risk factor? And we also ask a group of people who do not have the disease. So an example might be if we were looking at mesothelioma, which is great because it is a rare disease and case control studies are great for rare diseases. So we get a group of people who have the disease, who have mesothelioma, and we also get a group of people who do not have mesothelioma, and we asked both groups, do you remember being exposed to asbestos, and then we compare between those two groups, how often they remember having the exposure, and we make this comparison using something called an odds ratio, and like relative risk, it's important but we're not going to talk about it here. There's going to be another video. Just remember that odds ratio goes with case control. All right so those are the observational studies. Just to note observational studies cannot establish causation. So what that means is you cannot use an observational study to say that an exposure, a specific exposure causes a specific outcome. You can only say that there's an association there. If you want to be able to say that an exposure caused an outcome, you need an intervention, and studies that have interventions are called experimental studies, and just remember, that an intervention is something that a researcher gives to people in the experiment. If you want to have a good experiment, you need to also have something called a control group, and this is to make comparisons. So the intervention receives the thing, whatever it is that the researcher is giving the study group. This is what we're interested in studying. The control group receives anything except for the thing that we are looking at, not the intervention, not the thing. So this can be a placebo, so people think that they are getting the intervention when they're actually not. It can be an existing treatment, usually in the standard of care, or it can be nothing at all. The point is that it is not the intervention, and if you want to have a good experimental study, you should also have something called randomization. This is where you decide who gets the intervention and who gets not the intervention, and you do it just using random chance like a coin flip, and that's how you assign the group, control versus intervention, and really quickly, I just want to mention a type of study called a crossover study. It's really cool. It's where people who were in the control group half way through the study switch and receive the intervention, and likewise, people who were receiving the intervention switch and receive the control, and they cross over, so this is called a crossover study design. This is really cool, because people act as their own control and it is a great way to minimize bias. Now, bias is something that we haven't mentioned yet, but it's really important. It gets its own video, but the purpose of having a control group is to minimize bias, and the purpose of randomizing who goes to what group is also to minimize bias. Bias is bad, we want as little as possible. Okay. Speaking of bias, how much bias an experimental study gets is, kind of, another way that we can break down experimental studies. So it's -- actually we're going to be asking who gets blinded in our experimental study, and what blinding means is hiding the group assignment, and you can blind the patient so they don't know whether they are in the intervention or the control group or you can also blind the researcher so they don't know which group the patient has been assigned to. So if no one is blinded, if everybody knows what group they're in, if the patients know that they're getting the placebo or they know that they're getting the treatment and the researchers know too, what you have is an open label study. Open label studies are not preferred, because they have the greatest risk of bias, because everybody knows what group they're in, but sometimes you can't avoid it, so you're kind of, stuck. What would be better is if you can blind at least the patient. So the patient doesn't know whether they're getting the intervention or they're getting something else. This reduces the amount of bias and this gives you a single blind study. So you have less bias here, but you still have some, because the experimenter or the researcher knows what group. So better still is if you can blind both the patient and the researcher. This results in a double-blind study. These are most preferred, because they have the least amount of bias of these three study designs. So to review, bias is bad and in experimental studies we use control groups and randomization and blinding to minimize bias. Within observational studies, there are two important study designs that you need to be able to tell the difference between and those are case control and cohorts studies. Look out for my video on risk to learn more about these, and that is study design. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content.

﻿This lecture is going to be a pretty quick review of what you need to know about vaccines in America. First thing, if you have foreign travel we're not going to cover those diseases or those vaccines. In pediatrics, in infectious rashes and pediatrics vaccinations, we go over the diseases that are caused by the bugs we vaccinate against. We're not going to do that here. We're going to emphasize adult vaccinations when you need to give them and when you can't. So let's start with that when you can't. What is a true contraindication to somebody getting a vaccine? The first thing you have to look out for and is absolutely contraindication is going to be anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction to a medication or a vaccine. And generally, if you have an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine, you shouldn't get that vaccine again. Most vaccines require multiple doses and so, you find another way to protect that person. The second one comes up a lot is going to be eggs, and egg allergy. And this is because in the past we have grown our vaccines in eggs. And so, people who have a true anaphylactic reaction to eggs were put at risk and said not to have these vaccines. For the most part, we don't make vaccines in eggs anymore strictly because of this purpose. Therefore, the things that used to be a contraindication like the intramuscular flu and the MMRV are no longer contraindicated. The flu IM is a plus minus and so, what we've done is created the flu intranasal, a live attenuated vaccine that can be used if someone has an anaphylactic reaction to the intramuscular version. I'm going to put a dash line through flu intramuscular because very soon you will not have this as a consideration. But one, you still do want to make sure because you don't want to cause an anaphylactic reaction and two, because the test may not have caught up yet to the fact that we're making our flu vaccines free of eggs. I'm going to put a line through intranasal because intranasal is not made in eggs, but it is live attenuated which we'll talk about next. I'm going to put a line through the MMRV which used to be made in eggs and no longer is. That is to say you probably going to have a tough time predicting which vaccine is going to cause anaphylaxis. So it's only those people who have had a bad reaction in the past that is anaphylactic and not just a little red or sore that can't have them. The idea being, give the vaccines. The last thing to consider is the live attenuated. Live attenuated vaccines or contraindicated in anyone who is immunosuppressed. And usually, this means really bad immunosuppression, biologics for transplants, HIV, really old or really young. These vaccines are live attenuated, so that means you can give them the actual virus by giving them the vaccine. But they must be profoundly immunocompromised and they have to go out of their way to tell you, I really shouldn't have this. Someone who's got a CD4 count of four may not take to the vaccine. That is their immune system may not be robust enough to develop the immune response. But if you give someone with a CD count of four a live attenuated vaccine, you may actually inoculate them and give them the disease. The things you want to watch out for for immunodepressed patients is going to be the intranasal flu, the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and zoster. There really isn't a way to get around this, you're going to of course use intramuscular fluid if there's no egg anaphylaxis. If they are profoundly immunocompromised, you should not give them these vaccines. And instead, you should vaccinate them before they become immunocompromised or wait for them to get better before you do. Again, the emphasis here is if you're considering giving someone a vaccine, it's probably the right answer and they should get it. But now I want to talk about the individual vaccines and that is, you want to break it down by vaccine, how often you should get it, when you start and how frequently. And then what really is a problem or a contraindication to getting this particular vaccine. Because we've learned, the global stuff really shouldn't prohibit someone from getting a vaccine. The one you're probably going to get a test question about is Tdap. Not to be confused with the Dtap, also, tetanus toxoid or tetanus diphtheria. This gets very convoluted very quickly which you can see with four options how this could very easily become a test question. The capital D in Dtap is for a much higher dose than in the Tdap. You give a much higher dose when you're trying to prime a weak immune system. Dtap is for kids. Don't pick Dtap for adults. Tetanus toxoid and TD, tetanus diphtheria are the options you have when you can't give a Tdap. These are never going to be the right answer on their own. The CDC even says this, if you have an opportunity to give the Tdap, give it. Which means it's going to be the answer to give the vaccine. What you're supposed to do is give this every ten years for three lifetime doses. And the question you are going to get on the test is going to be, what do you do with the wound? Forget clean wounds, those are easy. What you want to look at is how many lifetime doses they've had and when the last one was. If you've had greater than three lifetime doses, you're good. Which means you can simply clean the wound if it's been less than 10 years since your last one or give a booster if it's greater than 10 years. If you've had less than three lifetime doses, you're going to need to give a booster if it's been less than five years. And the booster plus IVIG if it's been greater than five years. That's a long winded one to understand and we talked a lot about this in the peds vaccination lecture. What I want to see is Q ten years, three doses. And then break it down by how many lifetime doses you've had versus how close are you. And notice I wrote TD. That's the booster. It's okay to use that after you've had a whole bunch of doses and Tdap. But it's also okay to use Tdap when you give a booster. When you have an opportunity to give Tdap, give it. Contraindication here is going to be anaphylaxis. And this is one of those you get a bunch of times, so you'll know if there's a problem. The test question won't do this to you, but if you have a bad reaction to Tdap, which has three things in it, you might drop the acellular pertussis to do the next one and see if a bad reaction occurs. The goal is to prevent disease. And if you lose the acellular pertussis and that's the thing that cause anaphylaxis, you can still give the tetanus booster. A pneumococcal vaccine is actually just as confusing. And so, I'm going to make it simple. What I want you to hear is once before 60 and then once after 65. There's a lot to know in here and I'm carving it down to bare bones. You are going to use the 23 valent for a person who is older than 65. You are going to use the 13 valent for someone who is less than 60. You should complete a 13 series as a child. You can get a 13 again as an adult. The people who need it are those people who have disease, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes. Basically, if you're a medical patient, you need the shot. But the people who absolutely must have it is everybody over the age of 65. Keep it simple, once before 60, once after 65. And those who know a lot about this vaccine know why I'm saying what I'm saying. I want you to remember before 60 and after 65. And just to emphasize the point, you never, never give 13 and 23 at the same time. How would you do that? 13's before 60, 23's after 65. The zoster vaccine prevents shingles, and the recommendation is everybody gets the zoster vaccine regardless of your varicella disease state. That's going to change as the kids who currently get the varicella vaccine don't have chicken pox. You can't get shingles unless you've had chicken pox. But those people who are older than 30, did not get varicella vaccinations and they're going to need zoster. Zoster prevents shingles, shingles hurts, post herpetic neuralgia, bad stuff, everybody who is over the age of 60 needs a zoster shot. Now, zoster is live attenuated. So those who are truly immunosuppressed should wait till they're no longer immunosuppressed in order to get the zoster vaccine. Influenza must be given to everybody. It is everybody every year without fail. Healthcare workers, nursing home residents, show up to the clinic, show up to the Wal-Mart, show to Walgreens, show up to the street corner where they happen to be handing out the flu vaccine. Everybody gets a flu vaccine and it happens every year. Just remember there's this thing plus minus eggs for the intramuscular and live attenuated for the intranasal. You have to have a really, really, really strong suspicion that the interim muscular injections going to cause a problem in order to give it. HPV vaccine prevents cancer. Sounds like a pretty good thing to me. And now, it is indicated for everyone 9 to 26 boys and girls, if boys get vaccinated they can't give it to the girls when they have sex later. If the girls have the vaccine, it doesn't matter of the boys give it to them because the girls are vaccinated against it. It prevents cervical cancer and there's literally no reason not to get it. Specifically receiving the HPV vaccine does not increase sexual activity or risk-taking behavior. Being protected just to keep them protected. In the last one of sort of the adolescent vaccinations is the meningococcal. It prevents meningitis and its neisseria meningitidis, this the one that kills you in 24 hours, so everybody should get this. But the people who must have it are going to be those who are going to be near other people who might have it and kill a bunch of people. That is those in college dormitories and those going to the military, army barracks. In American society, it's everybody, but specifically those who go to college or army barracks. There is no reason not to get this. I do want to revisit some of the pediatric vaccines just in case you hadn't watched that lecture yet to emphasize a few points. Hib causes epiglottitis. If you give the vaccine, kids don't die of epiglottitis. Give the Hib vaccine. Hep A and Hep B vaccines, everybody should get. What I want you to remember is that there are two doses of A and three doses of B. What's important for adults is that if there is a record of Hep A B vaccination and it's incomplete, you can simply complete or pick up where you left off. You do not need to start again. If you have no idea or no records of what their -- Hep A B status is, don't get titers, just revaccinated. And lastly, is the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, everybody gets this. We talk more about the measles mumps rubella varicella vaccine in peds infectious rashes. We talked more about hepatitis B and what to do during birth, during peds vaccinations. We talked more about the Hib vaccine and epiglottitis in the pediatric lectures. Upper airway, HPV is discussed in cervical cancer in the GYN sections, and Tdap is discussed in more detail in the peds vaccinations lecture. So what I want to point out is that there are very few reasons that someone should not get a vaccine. Personal choice is one of them, that's an ethical issue, they should get the vaccine. Everybody should get vaccines. The Tdap is every ten years for three doses total. Worry about the dirty wound thing in that peds lecture. Pneumococcal, once before 60 and once after 65. It's not true, but if you remember that you're going to get it right most of the time. Zoster greater than 60, everybody gets it unless you're immunosuppressed. Flu vaccine, everybody every year, don't worry about that egg thing or you also have the option to use intranasal, which is used when there's an anaphylactic reaction to IM and you are not immunosuppressed. HPV cures cancer before it shows up, we prevent cancer, and everybody gets it. Meningococcal vaccine, everyone should get that one too, but it is necessary for college and the military, and don't forget about the kid ones, you have Hib, epiglottitis, Hep A, B, complete the series wherever you left off, and MMRV prevent these diseases by giving that vaccine. That is preventative vaccinations. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Anterior Chapman Points]  
﻿In this lecture, we're going to discuss Chapman's points. And unfortunately, it's nother memorization lecture. Instead of showing a chart, I'm going to demonstrate how I was taught how to draw out the Chapman's points. It's the only thing that worked for me, so I'm going to teach it for you. The Chapman's point is a two or three millimeter papule that represents a viscerosomatic reflex located on the anterior or posterior side of the body. What they are used for now is really to help aid in diagnosis, and not necessarily for treatment. So we're going to go ahead and demonstrate how to draw these things out. So we're going to draw some clavicles and then twelve ribs, and draw our midline. So there are a couple points located around the clavicle and rib 1. You have the ear, the nose and the pharynx. Next we're going to move into the inner space where you have the tonsils, the larynx and the tongue, and finally the sinus. So the next points are going to be outlined in the rib interspaces. So you put a point here, three points here, and then points going all the way back up. You can number your ribs so you know which rib interspace you are in to help you keep these straight. This first dot in the second rib interspace is for the heart. Continue to move down, and this one's for stomach acid. The next is for stomach motility, then you have the spleen. Moving over, you have the pancreas, the liver and gallbladder, another point for the liver, the lower lungs and the upper lung. This final point is almost a grab bag. You have the thyroid, you have the bronchus, you have the esophagus and the myocardium. To finish off the points on the anterior side of your ribs, you can place three points like this. These three points bilaterally are going to represent your small intestine. The next set of points are around your belly button on your abdomen, so this will be your belly button. One inch lateral and one inch superior you have another point, and one inch superior to that is another. These represent the adrenal gland, the kidney and the area around the umbilicus is for the bladder. There are some Chapman's points located in your pelvic area. So imagine this is one of your innominates. You have a point at the pubic tubercle, which represents the ovary and the urethra. And another point located more inferior that represents the uterus. The next points are going to be located on the anterior side of your thighs, and they represent the colon. So we all know how the colon runs, where you have the ascending transverse, descending and sigmoid. Just imagine that and flip it over on itself, and that will represent the locations for the colon Chapman's points on your thighs. So if we're going to draw this out, it will look like this, where we have the cecum, the descending colon, portions of the transverse colon, running back over to the sigmoid like so. Then imagine that our thigh is right here, and this is the rest of the foot, to demonstrate. There's another point back here for the prostate. That's going to be located on the posterior side of your thigh. There are two other random ones that don't really fit into the organizer anywhere, so we're going to have to write them out. So the coracoid will represent the cerebellum, and finally the most random point of all of them, on the lateral superior humerus, that's going to represent your retina and your conjunctiva. So this is how I was taught to remember the Chapman's points. I hope it helps you remember where the Chapman's points are as well, instead of having to memorize the chart. Where we talked about the anterior Chapman's points located in the rib area, if you can see, it kind of makes sense as you go from the superior side of the body to the inferior, you have a group of ENT, then you have the heart and upper lungs, and as you move further down in the body, you're going to reach the stomach, the liver, the pancreas and the small intestine. Everything over here is more difficult stuff to remember. And that's OMM Chapman's points. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Autonomic Levels]  
﻿Autonomics is one of the most high yield topics that we're going to go over in this course. Up until now, we've talked about dysfunction in terms of muscle, bone, attachment, insertion, and things that you can physically palpate. But this is completely different. We're going to be talking about visceral and organ dysfunction and relating that to a somatic dysfunction. So the important concept that you need to be able to do is relate the somatic level of where you may find a dysfunction, and relate that back to a visceral dysfunction or an organ dysfunction. You need to be able to flip that backward as well. If there is some sort of visceral issue, you need to be able to anticipate where you can palpate that as a somatic finding. The visceral organs are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. And the autonomic nervous system can be divided into two sections. You have the sympathetics and the parasympathetics. We're not going to go over what happens to each organ for sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow, but just remember sympathetics are your fight or flight response, and parasympathetics are more rest and digest. So when you're thinking parasympathetics, think pieces on the time. So to start off with, we're going to go over the sympathetic levels. So the way that I'm going to divide this out is I'm going to write out each level and what structures are innervated by it, but I'm also going to draw a picture in the same color to help it stick a little bit better. So we're going to start off with T1 to T6. In this range, you're going to think of the head, the neck, esophagus, the heart and the lungs. So as a picture, you have the head, the neck, the esophagus, the heart and the lungs. So the next level is going to be T5 through T9. When you think of a ganglia here, think of the celiac ganglia. The organs that are going to be innervated for this level include the stomach, duodenum, the pancreas, the liver, the gallbladder and the spleen. So to draw that out, you have the stomach, the liver the gallbladder, the pancreas and the spleen. And finally, the duodenum. So the next level we have T10 and T11. When you're thinking of ganglia here, think of the superior mesenteric ganglia, and for organs being innervated, think about the remainder of the small intestine after the duodenum, the cecum, the appendix, the ascending colon, the first half of the transverse colon, the kidneys, the upper ureters, and finally the gonads. Now you're thinking T10 and 11 for the gonads, why is that? Male gonads are so low, why is it innervated by T10 and 11? So think about embryologically, the gonads begin up in the abdomen around T10 and T11. Throughout the development process, the gonads descend into the scrotal sac, whereas the ovaries just stay where they are. So remember, gonads are strange. T10, T11. So drawing that out, we have the remainder of the small intestine, we have the cecum, the ascending colon and the first half of the transverse colon, as well as the appendix. We also have the kidneys and the upper ureters. So now the final level, T12 through L2. When you're thinking of a ganglia, think of the inferior mesenteric ganglia. When you're thinking of structures that are going to be innervated here, think of the rest of the colon, the lower ureters, the bladder, the prostate and the rest of your sex organs, excluding the gonads. So drawing that out, we're going to have the rest of the colon, the lower part of the ureters, the bladder, the prostate and all of your sex organs except for the gonads. So you're looking at the picture, one thing that you may realize is that everything is innervated in a top down approach. So you have the head and neck, the upper area. You have the upper gastric area, the middle area, and so on and so forth. The only weird part is going to be the GI tract, so you have to think about where exactly the food is passing along the tract as you're eating, to think about innervation levels. And remember, the only really weird one is the gonads. So now we're going to transition over to the parasympathetic levels. This section's going to be a lot easier than the sympathetic levels, because there's only two options. We also don't have to suffer through any more drawings. So the two options that we have are the vagus nerve and the pelvic splanchnic nerves. So how exactly is this divided? One line right there. Everything above the line will have vagus parasympathetic innervation. And everything below it will be pelvic splanchnic. And that's it for parasympathetics, super easy. So how are we going to be treating these? Well, when you're doing autonomic treatments, the main thing that you have to remember is your treatment will not increase outflow. What it's going to do is decrease the innervation facilitation. So when you're doing the treatment, you're trying to decrease the sympathetics or you're trying to decrease the parasympathetic outflow to the area. So for your treatment, you're trying to down regulate the sympathetics. You're going to try paraspinal inhibition. And the most common paraspinal inhibition that students know is rib raising. So if you are trying to decrease sympathetic facilitation to one of these organs, you go to the level and you perform the rib raising treatment. You can also perform a direct ganglia release. The ganglia are the ones that we outlined. So direct ganglia release. So how about parasympathetic? It's going to be different if you're trying to treat the vagus or the pelvic splanchnics. So vagus, you're going to want to treat the OA, and for the pelvic splanchnics, you're going to want to treat the sacrum. When you're treating the sacrum, you're going to think of inhibitory techniques. So you can think of sacral rocking and facilitation maneuvers. So the autonomics, the important thing that you have to know is being able to relate the visceral dysfunction back to your somatic level finding. You also need to be able to flip it and say if you find a somatic dysfunction in a certain area, they might be trying to point you toward some sort of visceral dysfunction. So we went over all of the sympathetic levels, suffered through another picture, and then talked about the parasympathetics and the treatment style. And that's OMM for autonomics. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Cervical Spine Diagnosis and HVLA]  
﻿In this lecture, we're going to be talking about the cervical region. This lecture is going to be divided into two parts. The first part is we're going to learn how to diagnose the cervical vertebra, and then we're going to move into an important muscle that's also located in the neck, the sternocleidomastoid. So in the previous video, we just found out how to diagnose the thoracic spine. Why do we need to learn it again? So doing the same diagnostic pattern for the cervical spine will not work. It's going to be different. And it's different because there's no Fryette's laws. So when you're diagnosing the thoracic spine, you cannot use Fryette's laws. You have a completely different set. So before we go into that, we have to know what the primary motion of each cervical vertebrae is. So your first area is C0, which is also known as the OA. The primary motion of this segment is flexion and extension. This will come into play when we start doing our diagnostics. So the next one is C1, which is also the AA. Primary motion here is rotation. Then you have C2 through 4. The primary motion is also rotation. And then you have the bottom cervical, you have C5 through C7. The primary motion here is going to be side bending. So how is the diagnostic pattern different? You're going to go through the same flow of assessing in neutral, assessing in flexion and assessing in extension. But instead of looking at rotation, you're going to be looking at translation and side bending. And the rules that that's going to follow is going to be on this chart. So for C0 and C1, side bending and rotation occur in opposite directions, meaning that if on an exam or in the clinic you're palpating the area and you notice that the patient can side bend to the left, you know that rotation is in the opposite direction. So they can rotate to the right. When you're assessing for this side bending, you're going to use what's called translation. So what is translation? Imagine that you're palpating the back side of the cervical spine. What you're going to do is you're going to use your fingers and push side to side on the cervical spine. So you're translating from one side to the other. So if I'm pushing from the right to the left, this is going to be left translation. But this is where people will get tripped up. You're doing left translation, but when you're making that motion, the cervical vertebra collapse to the right, and this induces right side bending. So if someone tells you that you can translate to the left, they're basically saying that you can side bend to the right. So that's how you translate. So going back to C2 and C7, side bending and rotation here are going to be different. They are going to rotate in the same direction. And how do you assess for this motion is the same, translation. So why is C1 written in red? It's a little bit different than the rest of them. Instead of trying to do translation, you're going to induce rotation. So what you're going to do is you're going to flex the spine to the level to 45 degrees, and then you are going to rotate the patient's head. This rotation is then going to tell you what direction you can and cannot rotate. And then using the same rule, you can tell that rotation and side bending occur in the opposite direction. So if they can rotate to the right, then they can side bend to the left. So let's go through a couple practice questions. So for this first one, in the exam they tell you that during flexion, the patient can side bend both directions normally. But during extension, the patient cannot side bend to the left. And let's say that these findings are for C4. So what's the diagnosis? So you follow the same rules. You always name it by what it can do. So looking back at the question, it can go into flexion normally, and it can side bend normally during flexion. So you can already say it's C4, flexed, something. You know it's going to be rotated and side bent to some direction. They tell you that during extension, you cannot side bend to the left. Remember, you always have to name a dysfunction by what it can do. So if it cannot side bend to the left, that means that it can side bend to the right. So can side bend to the right. And then following our rules for rotation and side bending, C4, side bending and rotation are in the same direction, so you're going to be C4 flexed, rotated right, side bent right. So for the next example, they tell you that during flexion you cannot translate to the left. This means that when they try and translate to the left, it doesn't want to go. But during extension, totally fine with translation. So translation is fine in both directions during extension. Let's say our findings are for C4, what's the diagnosis? Once again, same flow chart as always. You always name it by what it can do. So we're going to say C4 in extension translation is normal, so it's an extended dysfunction. You know it's going to be rotated and side bent in some direction. So they tell you that during flexion you cannot translate to the left. This means that you can translate to the right. But when you translate to the right, you have to remember that you are inducing left side bending. So it's a really important concept to understand which direction you're translation and what side bending direction that induces. So if you cannot translate to the left, that means that you can translate to the right, which means that you are inducing left side bending. So side bending to the left. And since it's C4, follow our chart, side bending and rotation are in the same direction. So our diagnosis is C4 extended, rotated left, side bent to the left. So now how do we treat this dysfunction? You can treat it many different ways, like we talked about in the previous lectures. You can do muscle energy, you can do HVLA, you can even do counterstrain if you want to. It's all up to what you're comfortable with, because there's no right answer for which one is better. So in this discussion, it'll be easier to give a demonstration on HVLA. So HVLA. So as we discussed previously, HVLA is a direct technique, meaning that we engage the restrictive barrier or we engage what the patient cannot do. And it's also passive. Passive means that the patient does not assist during treatment. They're totally relaxed. The practitioner does everything for the patient. There are some contraindications to HVLA, which you need to be looking out for in your patients and on the exam. If they give you one of these contraindications, HVLA is not the right answer. You need to pick a different treatment style. So what are the contraindications? So you have osteoporosis. You can have fractures and metastatic cancer. So just think about it this way. Osteoporosis, fractures and metastatic bone cancer can lead to a weakness in the vertebra. You don't want to be cracking weak vertebra, so don't do HVLA, you'll cause more damage than good. So what are some other contraindications? Rheumatoid arthritis and Down syndrome. So a contraindication to rheumatoid and Down is going to be the same thing. For both of these diagnoses, you have an unstable transverse ligament. Because of this instability, you are not able to perform and HVLA treatment technique because you'll cause harm. So if you see any of these, you are not allowed to treat the patient with HVLA. You have to pick something else. Easy way to remember this is that older individuals like Granny might have osteoporosis, fractures, cancer, maybe she's got rheumatoid. Don't be cracking Granny's neck. Choose something else. So there are two different types of HVLA treatments. You can have rotational HVLA, and you can have side bending HVLA. Both of these treatment styles are very similar in that they're direct and passive, but the setup is just slightly different, and I'll go through an example with the cervical spine. So let's say that you have a diagnosis of C5 FRS right. So I'm saying that's C5, can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. So how am I going to set this up for treatment? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the patient into the barrier, because it's a direct treatment. So put them into the position that they cannot do. So I'm going to induce slight extension. It's a rotational HVLA technique, so I'm going to set them into the rotational barrier first. So we're going to rotate to the left and then the last plane of motion is side bending. So I'm going to side bend to the left. The next part of the treatment is to get the patient to relax. You want them to take a couple deep breaths, get chilled out. It's easier to perform the HVLA technique when the patient is relaxed and they're not constricting their muscles anticipating an HVLA press. So wait until they're relaxed, instruct the patient to breathe. So the next step is one that they are totally relaxed, you can then induce your HVLA force. Because this is a rotational HVLA treatment, you're HVLA movement is going to be in rotation through the direct barrier. So you're going to HVLA, rotate left. So you're going to perform the rotary force through the barrier, which is to the left. After you perform the treatment, you are then going to passively return the patient to neutral and then you're going to rescreen. So remember, after any treatment, whether it's HVLA, muscle energy or whatever, you have to return the patient to neutral and you have to rescreen to see if your treatment worked. So now for side bending HVLA. Let's say once again our diagnosis is the same. So we'll say C5, FRS right. C5 can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. It's still a direct technique, so we're going to set him up into the barrier. So we're going to induce slight extension, it's a side bending treatment, so we're going to do side bending first into the barrier. So we're going to side bend to the left and this is where it's a little bit different for the cervical HVLA. Instead of rotating into the barrier, you're going to rotate into the freedom. So you're going to rotate right. The reason that you rotate right for this treatment is so that you can lock out the facets for everything above and below it for your treatment. So it really directs the treatment towards C5 and not anywhere else. So the important thing for you to see here is that rotation goes to the freedom for side bending, but it goes into the barrier for rotation. The rest of the steps are exactly the same. So you're going to have the patient relax. Once he's relaxed, you're going to do your HVLA force. Because it's a side bending HVLA treatment, you're going to induce your HVLA force through translation to the right. So this is where you have to remember, translating to the right means that you're inducing left side bending, and that is the barrier that you're going for, left side bending. So once you've done your HVLA thrusts, you then return the patient back to neutral and just like any other treatment, you always rescreen. So this is where we're going to break the lecture and stop talking about vertebra and we're going to start talking about a very important muscle that's located in the neck, the SCM, the sternocleidomastoid. So the SCM has two origins. It has a sternal head, which originates on the manubrium, so right at the top of the sternum. You have the clavicular head, which originates on the medial one-third of the clavicle. So the sternal head originates on the manubrium, the clavicular head originates on the medial one-third of the clavicle. The attachment is going to be the mastoid process. So now that you know where the SCM originates and where it attaches or inserts, you can now get an idea of what the SCM does when it contracts. So if your origin and insertion are here and you're contracting your muscle to bring the origin and the insertion closer together, you're inducing flexion, side bending towards, and rotating away. So as I'm making this motion, the origin and attachment are coming closer together. So what happens when the SCM is dysfunctional? Well, if you think about when the muscle is dysfunctional and it becomes hypertonic, it's going to shorten and it's going to try and stay very locked up in this position of what it can do. So if you know the anatomy, then you already know what happens during dysfunction. It does exactly what it does during normal motion, it just gets stuck that way. So the freedom for this dysfunction is going to be flexion, side bending towards and rotating away. The barrier of this dysfunction is going to be the opposite, or what it cannot do. So the barrier is extension, side bending away, rotating towards. Again, when the SCM is hypertonic, it wants to do this, it cannot do the opposite. So how do I do the treatment? So once again, this is going to be a recurring theme throughout the entire thing. You need to understand the concepts and then apply them to everything else. So if you're treating the SCM you can do it many ways. You can do muscle energy, engage the barrier, ask the patient to isometrically move into the freedom and keep them going. But for this discussion, we're going to talk about the counterstrain for this point. So we're going to do counterstrain to the SCM. Since the SCM has two origins, it can have two different treatments. We're going to talk about the main treatment position. This position is AC7. So the clavicular head insertion on the medial third of the clavicle is where AC7 is located. The sternal head is where AC8 is located. In this discussion, we're going to talk about AC7. So what's the treatment position? Remember, counterstrain is always fold and hold. And to do that, you bring the origin and insertion closer together. So you do what the muscle can do. So you already know what the treatment setup is. You know that the muscle can flex, side bend toward, rotate away. So for counterstrain for the SCM, you're going to flex, side bend toward, rotate away. So this lecture was broken up into two different segments. We talked about how you can diagnose the cervical vertebra and that there's no Fryette's laws in this area. You have to follow a different chart. We talked about how you induce translation and how it relates to side bending. We did some practice questions, gave some examples of HVLA, and definitely some contraindications, and then we switched gears, talked about the sternocleidomastoid and related it to counterstrain. And that's OMM for the cervical spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Cranial]  
﻿The topic of cranial is all about understanding the motion of two bones in relation to one another. It's usually difficult for students because there's a lot of 3D spatial awareness. But what I've done in this lecture is broken down these complex 3D motions into 2D structures that you can easily identify. So to first go over it, here's a picture of the two bones that we're talking about from a side view. Here's where the sphenoid is, here's the occiput, and here is the SBS joint, or the sphenobasilar synchondrosis. This joint is what we're going to be naming all the dysfunctions of. From a top down view, here is where the sphenoid is, here's where the occiput is, and here is that SBS joint. Remember, the SBS joint is the articulation between the sphenoid and the occiput where all motion rotates around. So to start off with, we're going to talk about how you can palpate these motions using the vault hold. The vault hold is going to tell you where you are going to hold your fingers in order to palpate the motion. Your index finger will be at the greater wing of the sphenoid. Your middle finger will be located on the temporal bone in front of the ear. Your ring finger will also be located on the temporal bone in the mastoid area, and your little finger will be on the squamous portion of the occiput. The main two points for you to get the diagnosis will be the index finger and the little finger. The index finger is palpating the motion of the sphenoid, and the little finger is palpating the motion of the occiput. So now I'm going to draw out the SBS joint where the sphenobasilar synchondrosis is and how the sphenoid and occiput relate to one another from three views - a view from the side, a view top down, and a view from the posterior view. So throughout all of these drawings, we're going to have the sphenoid in red and the occiput in blue. For a top down view, you're going to see this, where red is sphenoid, blue is occiput. And from a posterior to anterior view, you'll see this, where the two wings of the sphenoid are both level. So the two primary motions of the SBS are going to be flexion and extension. During flexion, the sphenoid and the occiput rotate outward. Now recall from the sacrum video, we had mentioned craniosacral motion, along with nutation and counternutation. When the SBS goes into flexion, the sacrum is going to move into counternutation. The sacrum will be pulled back posterior. The way you can think of this is as if there is a line that attaches the occiput to the top of the sacrum. So when the occiput rotates outward, it's going to tug the sacrum back up with it and dip it into counternutation. When you go into flexion, you are going to have a short AP axis, a wide transverse axis, and your sacrum will counternutate. The next motion is extension. Extension is the motion that's going to happen after flexion. Extension will bring the sphenoid and the occiput back to neutral. So it's going to look like this. So the occiput will rotate back down and the sphenoid will rotate back down. So the sphenoid and occiput are already in flexion. They're going to make this rotational movement to return back to neutral, and that movement is extension. When they make this movement, it's also going to move the sacrum. Now you still have that string that's on the sacrum. When the occiput rotates back down into neutral, the sacrum will then dip into nutation forward. So during extension, you're going to have a long AP axis, a narrow transverse axis, and your sacrum will nutate. So what about the rest of the cranial bones? During flexion, all other paired cranial bones will externally rotate. During extension, all paired cranial bones will internally rotate. This motion is what causes your short and long AP axis and your wide and narrow transverse axis. So now we're going to talk about dysfunctional motion and some different diagnoses that you can have in the world of cranial. So our first one is going to be a torsion. So here's what a drawing will look like from the posterior view. You have your occiput, and then you have your sphenoid. The motion that's occurring here is a twisting motion along an AP axis. Now the twisting motion is going to be different for the sphenoid and the occiput. Imagine that this hand is for the sphenoid and this one is for the occiput. While one hand rotates to the left, the other hand will rotate to the right. So this is the motion of a torsion from the posterior view. So here, the sphenoid is rotating to the left, while the occiput is rotating to the right. This motion occurs around an AP axis. And the motion is opposite of one another. So how do you name this dysfunction? You're going to name it based on which wing of the sphenoid is more superior. So in this drawing the right wing is more superior, so you have a right torsion. The second diagnosis that we're going to go over is a side bending and rotation. For this dysfunction, we're going to have the occiput and the sphenoid from a posterior view, except this time they both rotate in the same direction. So they both rotate to the left or they both rotate to the right along an AP axis. But there's also a second motion that happens. What happens here is there's rotation about two vertical axes, where they both rotate in opposite directions. So the sphenoid is rotating counterclockwise while the occiput is rotating clockwise. You're going to name this dysfunction based on which direction the sphenoid is rotating. So the sphenoid is rotating to the right, so this is a right side bending and rotation dysfunction. We discussed the rotation around the AP axis and they both rotate in the same direction. The rotation along the two vertical axes are in opposite directions. So there are three axes that side bending and rotation dysfunctions occur around. There's the AP axis where both bones rotate in the same direction, and then two vertical AP axes where they both rotate in the opposite direction. The next three dysfunctions are going to be something that you see in trauma patients. So the first one is going to be a shear. In this dysfunction, one bone is going to be rotated higher than the other. So the sphenoid will be rotating superiorly, while the occiput is rotating inferiorly. To name the dysfunction, you name which direction the sphenoid is rotating. So the sphenoid is rotating up, so this is an up shear or a superior shear. There are two axes that the bones rotate around, and they are both horizontal. So imagine the two axes are here and here, and both bones are rotating around the axes. Both bones are rotating in the same direction. In this example, they're both rotating counterclockwise. So in this example, you have an up shear or a vertical shear. The next dysfunction is lateral, and here you have the sphenoid and the occiput moving laterally in two different directions, the sphenoid moving right, the occiput moving left. You're going to name the dysfunction based on the direction the sphenoid is moving. The sphenoid is moving to the right, so we're going to name this right lateral. The final dysfunction that you may see is a compression dysfunction. In this dysfunction, both bones are coming together. So at the SBS, they're both compressing, so a compression dysfunction. So what are the indications that you're going to need to see in order to assess the patient for a cranial dysfunction? It can really be just about anything. So if the patient comes in and he's just saying, I don't feel so great, I'm tired, I have a headache, whatever, you can assess for cranial dysfunctions. If you're going to treat cranial, you're treatment pattern will be indirect. So remember, for indirect treatments, you push into the freedom or what they can do, or into the diagnosis. So if I want to treat a right torsion, I'm going to push the bones further into right torsion. So it's an indirect technique. The way that you're going to do this technique is with your fingers still in the vault hold and by moving into that motion. Two other techniques that you need to know the names of are CV4 and the V-spread. So a CV4 treatment is going to increase the patient's CRI, or cranial rhythmic impulse. A normal CRI is 8 to 12 per minute. If you want to increase the CRI, perform the CV4. V-spread is going to help you release sutures. When you release the sutures, you're going to have more motion at whatever suture you're treating. So we went over how to represent all of these dysfunctions pictorially, but what are you going to palpate when you're palpating the patient's cranium? So you have your fingers in the vault hold. You're going to have your pointers on the greater wing of the sphenoid and your little fingers on the squamous portion of the occiput. During flexion, you're going to feel both hands move towards the patient's feet while your fingers spread apart. So normal flexion will look like this, and this is what you'll palpate. Extension is going to bring you back to neutral. So once you're in flexion, extension will feel like this. Your fingers are going to come back where they started and your pointer and pinkie are going to be come closer together. So flexion and extension. What about torsion? When you're palpating a torsion, you always want to name based off whatever wing of the sphenoid is more superior. When you're doing this palpation, a torsion will feel like this motion. You're going to name it based on which wing of the sphenoid is more superior, and which finger is palpating that? Your pointer finger is. So if we're going to name a right torsion, the right pointer finger will be higher than the left. So right torsion, left torsion. What about side bending and rotation? Exaggerate the flexion and extension motions, just do them backwards. So one hand will go into flexion and the other hand will exaggerate into extension. Going the other direction, it will look like this, where one hand goes into the flexion motion and the other hand comes back and into exaggerated extension. You're going to name the dysfunction based on which hand goes further into flexion. So this will be a left side bending and rotation. Shears, you fingers will move in this direction. This will be an up shear. Up shear will move like this. A lateral strain is the parallelogram head that you remember from class. So you're going to feel this motion, where the fingers move into a parallelogram. You're going to name it based on which direction your pointer fingers are both going. So a right lateral shear, left lateral shear. So if you remember the hand motions, as well as the pictures that we've drawn, you should be really prepared for any cranial that comes up on your exams or even in the clinic. And that is OMM cranial. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Fibular Head and Foot Arches]  
﻿In this second and final video of the lower extremity, we're going to go over fibular head mechanics, the arches of the foot and some final counterstrain points of the lower extremity. In order to talk about the fibular head, we first have to talk about the motions of the foot. So we're going to start off there. So foot motions. Just like you can supinate and pronate your hand, you can also supinate and pronate your foot. So for pronation, if we want to do that with our foot we're going to have to go into dorsiflexion, eversion, AB duction, abduction. So what do those motions do? They take the foot a little bit further away from midline. So remember, dorsiflexion is when you bring your toes upward. Eversion is when you tilt your foot outward, away from the body, and abduction is when you take it further away. So that is going to be pronation. When you make that motion with your foot, other bony landmarks are also going to move to accommodate. So some motion is going to be in the talus and also in the tibia. When you pronate your foot, your talus and your tibia are going to accommodate by externally rotating. Your talus will also accommodate by moving posteriorly. So that's pronation. Let's move into supination. Remember, supination for your upper extremity is when you kind of turn your hand as if you're trying to hold a bowl of soup. It's the same idea for your feet as well, so imagine you're trying to hold a bowl of soup with your feet. For supination, it's going to be the opposite of pronation. So you're going to plantar flex, invert your foot and AD duct your foot, adduction. Remember that plantar flexion is when you point your toes down, inversion is when you tilt your foot inward, and AD duction is when you bring it closer to the midline. So if you do that with both of your feet, you might have a better chance holding a bowl of soup. When you do this, your talus and your tibia are going to accommodate this motion. It's going to be in the opposite direction. So talus and tibia will internally rotate and your talus will move anteriorly. So now that you understand the motions of the foot, we can now move into fibular head mechanics. Now the fibular head is going to be one of the main topics of this lecture, so you need to know the motions of the foot in order to understand the motions of the fibular head. So when you have your foot in neutral, the fibular head will also be in neutral. It'll be running parallel with the tibia. When you dorsiflex your foot, your fibular head is going to move. So when I dorsiflex, the fibular head will move anterior and the distal portion of the fibula will move posterior. So when you dorsiflex, you're going to have an anterior fibular head. It's going to be the opposite when you plantar flex. Your fibular head is going to go in the other direction. So when you plantar flex, the distal portion of your fibula will move anterior, and your fibular head will move posterior. So when you plantar flex, your fibular head will move posteriorly. P-P. So what are you going to see in a patient that has some sort of fibular head dysfunction? They'll potentially have some decreased range of motion in their ankle, which is because the fibular head is not moving properly. This lack of movement is going to cause a lack of accommodation for ankle motion into supination and pronation. What you can also see is pain in the ankle region, but also pain in the knee region. So if you have a patient who comes in with ankle pain and knee pain, you can potentially think of the fibula as being dysfunctional. Even if they come in with simply knee pain, you can still think of the fibula. So how do we make the diagnosis? You're going to do what's called the spring test. You're going to have the patient sitting on the edge of the examination table. You're going to pinch the fibular head bilaterally, and then you're going to spring the fibular head anteriorly and posteriorly. When you're doing this, you're going to assess for range of motion on both sides, and whichever side doesn't want to move furthest into one direction, then that's how you're going to know which side is dysfunctional and how to name it. Remember, you always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So if on the right side you're doing the spring test, it goes easily into the anterior motion but it doesn't really like to go posterior compared to the other side, that means you have a right anterior fibular head. So to get the diagnosis, you do the spring test. So how are we going to treat this dysfunction? We're going to use muscle energy. So remember back all the way at the beginning when we were talking about how you do muscle energy. You passively move the patient into the restrictive barrier, then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do, which is also the name of the diagnosis. So we're going to use that in order to set up the treatment. So let's say that we have an anterior fibular head first. So if you have an anterior fibular head, that means that the foot is more than likely in some sort of dorsiflexion. If it's in dorsiflexion, that means that your foot is pronated. So this is the freedom. This is what the foot can do. If you're going to put it into the barrier, that means you're going to put it into supination. So to achieve the barrier for this treatment, you put the foot into supination. So then what motion do we instruct the patient to move into for their isometric force? Move into the freedom. So what can they do? They can dorsiflex, because you have an anterior head dysfunction. So you put them into pronation. So you remember all the steps. You need to have them do this three times, move further into the barrier, then at the end bring them passively back to neutral and then you rescreen. It's going to be the exact opposite for the other dysfunction. So if you have a posterior fibular head, you're going to engage the restrictive barrier, posterior fibular head, plantar flexion, it likes to go into supination, the barrier is pronation. So pronation barrier and move into the freedom, which is the diagnosis, which is plantar flexion. Do the treatment, bring them passively back to neutral, rescreen. So now we're going to transition to a topic that still comes up on exams but is kind of more anatomy based. But we can talk about it in the OMM sense if you can think about manipulating where exactly the bones are by pushing them. So we're going to talk about the arches of the foot. Now we came up with an advanced organizer for this. It's going to be Tetris pieces. So you're going to see what I mean as I'm drawing this out. There are three different arches that we need to talk about, the transverse, the medial and the lateral. So I'll start out with transverse and we'll draw our Tetris piece. So in the Tetris piece we're going to have three bones: navicular, cuneiforms, and the cuboid. These three bones are going to make up your transverse arch. So the next two arches are your medial and lateral. So these two arches have the exact same Tetris piece as the transverse arch. So we'll start with that. Navicular, cuneiforms and the cuboid. So the transverse arch has the entire Tetris piece. It has the navicular, the cuneiforms and the cuboid. The medial and lateral arches share the Tetris piece. So the medial arch has a navicular and the cuneiforms, while the lateral arch has the cuboid. Because they share the Tetris piece, we're going to add in some extra bones. Each arch is going to get some of the metatarsals and one additional bone. So the medial arch is going to have metatarsals 1 through 3 and the talus, while the lateral arch is going to have metatarsals 4 through 5 and the calcaneus. So going over it again, transverse arch, the entire Tetris piece. Medial and lateral arches share the Tetris piece while they both have some extra metatarsals and one extra bone of the foot. So now we're going to finish the lecture with some counterstrain. But to talk about that, we're going to go over some of the ligaments of the ankle. So this is going to be your fibula, this is going to be your talus, and this will be your calcaneus. So imagine that the toes are this way, so we'll draw in some extra toes going this way. So there are three ligaments that we need to go over. We have the anterior talofibular, the calcaneofibular, and the posterior talofibular. So the name of the ligament gives away where it's located. Anterior talofibular is on the anterior side, connects the talus to the fibula. Posterior, same reason, and calcaneofibular exact same. The reason I point these out is so that you can know where the attachment and the origin of the ligaments are. So this is the final time that we have any counterstrain points. A moment of silence for counterstrain points. So counterstrain is an indirect technique. You bring the two ends closer together to make it do what it can do. So you're already going to beat me to this. How are we going to do counterstrain? So these ligaments are all on the lateral side of the foot. So if we're going to treat the lateral ankle and we need to bring the two ends closer together, we're going to evert the foot. Now imagine that we're on the medial side of the ankle. You have some different ligaments and different muscles that attach in that area as well. Don't worry about the names, but since they all attach in the same area, you're just going to bring the two ends together. And to do that, you're going to invert. And then one final one, plantar fascia. So a common thing that you'll see on the exams is an individual has lower foot pain when they wake up in the morning. It takes them a little while to stretch out. They can feel it right on the bottom of their foot or closer to their calcaneus. They're trying to point you toward plantar fasciitis. So how are you going to treat it with counterstrain? Bring the two ends closer together. So you're going to flex the foot and collapse it, and then add some compression to try and bring the two ends of the plantar fascia closer together. So for plantar fascia, you will flex and compress the foot. So this was our final lecture on lower extremity. We went over the motions of the foot and how to relate that to the fibular head mechanics. We went over the arches of the foot and used our Tetris piece example, and we also talked about the ankle, the ligaments and our final discussion on counterstrain. And that's lower extremity part two. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Forearm]  
﻿This is our third and final lecture of the upper extremity. In the first lecture, we went over dysfunctions of the shoulder area. In the second one we talked about the sits muscles, and in this lecture we're going to talk about the carrying angle, the radial head and some counterstrain points that you'll notice in the forearm. So we're going to start off with the carrying angle. So what is the carrying angle? Imagine that you're standing up straight and there is a heavy weight on the ground or a pail of water or backpack or whatever. When you pick up that weight, the angle that your arm is located is going to be the carrying angle. So to draw this out and how we calculate the carrying angle, we're going to have a few different axes of motion. So you have your humerus, your radius and your ulna. So there's two axes that you use to calculate the carrying angle. You're going to use a humoral axis, which runs directly down the shaft of the humerus, and then you are going to use the forearm axis, which is going to run between the radius and the ulna back towards the elbow. The carrying angle is going to be this angle here. In men, this angle is typically smaller than in women. In men, the typical angle is 5. In women, the typical angle is about 10. Usually you have plus or minus two degrees. So why are we talking about the carrying angle? So you can have two different types of carrying angle extremes. You can have cubitus valgus and you can have cubitus varus. So when we go over cubitus valgus first, imagine that someone is carrying a big weight, and instead of having their arm straight, their arm is going to look like a big L. Cubitus valgus. So their elbow is going to be close to their body and their wrist is going to be a little bit further out. So this is what we call cubitus valgus. So writing that out, cubitus valgus looks like a big L and it has an L in the name of it. This carrying angle is going to be greater than 15 degrees, and there are two landmarks that you need to know where they're located with this carrying angle. Imagine you have your arm in the shape of an L and you notice where your ulna and where your wrist are deviated. Your ulna is AB ducted, it's further away from your body, and your wrist is pointed towards you, so it's AD ducted, adducted. So they're both opposite. Your ulna is abducted, and your wrist is adducted. So writing this out, you have an abducted ulna and an adducted wrist. So the first type of carrying angle extreme that you can have is cubitus valgus. So what's cubitus varus? It's going to be the opposite. So instead of having a bit L angle, you're going to be kind of cattywonkus like this, where your elbow is further out and your wrist is really close to your body. The main difference that you need to see here is that your ulna is now AD ducted, it's closer to you, it's adducted, and your wrist is now pointed away from your body, so it's abducted, AB ducted. So writing that whole thing out, we have cubitus varus. The carrying angle that you're looking for is less than 3 degrees. You're going to have an AD ducted ulna and an AB ducted wrist. Don't worry about being able to fix the angle right now. Really, you're going to be asked to diagnose the carrying angle and understand where the landmarks are for each diagnosis. So we're going to leave the carrying angle behind and we're going to start talking about the radial head. So the radial head is the head of the radial bone. So it moves when you are supinating and pronating your arm. When your arm goes into supination, your radial head goes anteriorly. When you pronate, your radial head goes posteriorly. So writing that out, pronate equals posterior, and supinate goes anterior. So remember, we always name a dysfunction based on what it can do. So when we go through these examples, think about where the radial head likes to go during motion. So imagine that you fall forward onto an outstretched hand. When you fall forward, you're going to pronate your hand to catch yourself. And when you pronate your hand, your radial head is already posterior. Well, imagine when you do that motion, you're then going to jam your radial head where it currently is. So it's going to get stuck posterior, so you're going to have a posterior radial head dysfunction. So writing out the example, fall forward, pronated catch and a posterior dysfunction. So what about an anterior radial head? It's going to be the exact opposite. Imagine you fall backward. You're still going to try and catch yourself with your hand, but your hand is going to be supinated. When you supinate your hand, your radial head is anterior and it's going to jam it further anterior. That's where it likes to go, that's the name of the diagnosis. So writing it out, fall backward, supinated catch, anterior dysfunction. So how do we make this diagnosis in a patient? What we're going to do is we're going to have the patient seated. We're going to have both of his arms flex at 90 degrees, and then we're going to passively assess pronation and supination. Passively pronate, then passively supinate. We're going to measure which one doesn't want to go in a certain direction in order to make our diagnosis. But remember, name the diagnosis on what it can do. So to make the diagnosis, you're going to passively move. So how are we going to treat these dysfunctions? We're going to use muscle energy for this, and the reason is it's easy to set up a barrier and it's easy to give an isometric contraction. Both treatments are very similar to one another, but the barrier that you engage and the isometric force direction are going to be opposite to one another. So remember, all the way back at the beginning when we talked about what does muscle energy mean? You passively engage the barrier. You ask the patient to then move into the freedom of what they can do, move further into the restrictive barrier and so on and so forth. Same concept, different barriers. So for a posterior dysfunction, what's the barrier going to be? It's what they cannot do. If it's a posterior dysfunction, they cannot supinate. So the barrier that you're going to engage is a supination barrier. Now in what direction are you going to ask the patient to isometrically move? What they can do, into the freedom. So they can pronate. So if it's a posterior dysfunction, your barrier is supination, your isometric force is into pronation. It's going to be backwards for supination. So if it's a supinated dysfunction, the barrier that you're going to engage is pronation, and the isometric force direction into the freedom will be supination. After your treatment, make sure that you bring the patient back to neutral and rescreen. So this is all for the treatment. Diagnosis, barrier, freedom. Diagnosis, barrier, freedom. So to finish out upper extremity, we're going to go over some common counterstrain points that you're going to see. And there are three big ones that we're going to go over. The first one is going to be the long head of the bicep. I bet I know what you're thinking. I already know how to do the treatment. I put them into the passive position, the position of ease. I bring the muscle ends together. Exactly right. So to do this treatment, we're going to have the patient flex, AB duct and internally rotate. These three motions together bring the attachment and origin closer together for your treatment. The next position that we're going to talk about is medial epicondylitis. So medial epicondylitis is located on your medial epicondyle. All the muscles that attach to this are your forearm flexors. This is also known as golfer's elbow. So if all the forearm flexors attach to that location, what do you think the counterstrain position is going to be? Flexion. You're going to shorten the muscles. So you're going to flex the forearm, pronate and AD duction. The final one that we're going to talk about is the opposite of medial epicondylitis. It's lateral epicondylitis. It is called tennis elbow. The way that you can think about this is all the extensors of the forearm attach to that spot. Your treatment setup is going to be the exact opposite of the flexors. So just extend everything. So we have lateral epicondylitis, and you're just going to do everything backwards. So you're going to extend, supinate and AB duct. So we went over the treatment positions, but make sure that you don't forget the exact steps that you have to follow for counterstrain. You find the tender point, you make it a ten out of ten on the pain scale, passively move them into the position. Make sure it's less than three on the pain scale. Hold for 90 seconds, passively return to neutral and rescreen. You got to know all of the positions but you also have to remember the steps. So in this lecture, we went over three broad topics. We went over the carrying angle, how to calculate the angle and the two different diagnoses you can have. We went over radial head, pronation and supination, and some common falls that you're going to be asked about along with the treatment positions. And finally wrapped up with some counterstrain. And that's OMM for the forearm. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Hip Area and Knee v3]  
﻿Now we're going to begin our discussion on the lower extremity. We've divided this lesson into two different sections. This first section is going to go over Spencer technique for the hip, the important muscle piriformis, the ligaments of the knee and everyone's favorite counterstrain. So, we're going to start off with Spencer technique for the hip. So just like the Spencer technique for the shoulder, there's going to be different barriers that you need to engage during different portions of your treatment. So, the mnemonic to remember these barriers is Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin. Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin. These are going to be the barriers that you need to engage during treatment by moving the lower extremity. So, what are these barriers? Flexion, extension, compression with circumduction, traction with circumduction, internal rotation, external rotation, abduction and adduction. So, remember to engage these barriers you're going to move the lower extremity into these barriers. If it helps you remember, each two steps are opposite of one another. So, flexion extension, compression traction, internal external rotation, abduction adduction. B comes before D an alphabet, so abduction first. So next we're going to talk about the piriformis. You're going to see this muscle a lot in the clinic, but also on your practice questions. So, we're going to make sure to spend some time talking about it here. So, the origin of the piriformis is the posterior side of the sacrum. The insertion is the greater tubercle of the femur. So, knowing the origin and insertion and how muscles work, you have an idea of how that muscle is going to affect the body. So, when the muscle contracts, it brings the origin and insertion closer together knowing where these two are [indiscernible] those anything will make, external rotation of the lower extremity. So, function is lower extremity external rotation. So, what about when it's dysfunctional? Remember a dysfunctional muscle is just going to stay hypertonic. It's going to stay contracted which will pull the origin and insertion closer together and keep them there. So, you already know that position. It's going to be lower extremity external rotation. So, in dysfunctional you're going to see a patient that has lower extremity external rotation. Now here's a clinical correlate that will definitely come up. Remember from anatomy the sciatic nerve comes out just below the piriformis muscle. So, when the muscle is dysfunctional and becomes hypertonic, it can start to impend into sciatic nerve leading to shooting burning pains down the patient's leg. The patient presents like that in your clinic or if you happen to see that on some practice questions, they may be trying to get you to think about the piriformis. So, to help you remember that, I'm going to put sciatic nerve. So, how are we going to treat the piriformis? There're many ways to treat all the muscles in the body as long as you remember the core concepts from the treatment modality lesson. So here we're going to discuss how to treat the piriformis using muscle energy. Now muscle energy if you remember back, how do you perform it? You put the patient into the barrier of what they can't do. You have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do repeat three to five times, back to neutral, rescreen. So, for muscle energy you need to engage the barrier. Now the barrier for the piriformis is what it can't do. So, when it's dysfunctional external rotation, so what it can't do is internal rotation. So internal rotation is the barrier. Then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do, and you already know what they can do, they can externally rotate. So lower extremity external rotation is the freedom. So now we're going to leave the piriformis and start talking about the ligaments of the knee. So, here's your femur. Here's your tibia and here's your fibula. Now this isn't an anatomy course. Don't get too bogged down trying to think of the exact origin and insertion, just get an idea of where these ligaments are, what side of the knee the patient may have pain and where you would palpate the structures? So, on the patient's medial side they're going to have the MCL or the Medial Collateral Ligament and the medial meniscus. So, when you palpate it on the medial side, it'll be on the medial side. So medial is the MCL and medial meniscus and what about the lateral side? On the lateral side you're going to palpate the LCL and the lateral meniscus. So lateral LCL and lateral meniscus. Now you have the ACL and the PCL. You can't palpate the structures from the anterior side because of the patella, so both of these structures will be palpable from the posterior side. So, the ACL attaches to the anterior portion of the tibia and the posterior portion of the femur and you'll feel it from the posterior side. The PCL attaches to the posterior side of the tibia and the anterior side of the femur. You'll still feel it from the posterior side. So now that you have a general idea of where on the knee these structures are and where the patient may have a tender point, we're going to talk about everyone's favorite counterstrain. Now I think at this part in the lecture series, we've been counterstrain to death, fold and hold treatment, bring the origin and insertion closer together, hold for 90 seconds, go through all those steps. So, this should be pretty easy for you. Now that you know where the structures are on the knee. So, if you have an MCL or medial meniscus tender point on the medial side of the knee you'll treat it with flexion adduction, an internal rotation. So, you're going to flex the patient's knee, adduct the tibia and bring it closer to the body and then you're going to internally rotate the tibia. All these motions will bring both ends of the MCL closer together for your counterstrain treatment position and we're going to compare that to the LCL and the lateral meniscus. You're going to feel this tender point on the lateral side and because it's on the opposite side of the MCL, the treatment position will be the opposite. So flexion abduction and external rotation. So, you're going to once again flex at the knee, abduct the tibia, which will abduct the fibula bringing both ends of the LCL closer together and you will add external rotation of the lower extremity to get them even closer. So next you have the ACL and the PCL. Now to treat these two with counterstrain, you're going to have to use the third osteopathic arm, which is basically anything that you have in the office to help you during treatment setup. This could be a pillow, a bunch of T-shirts, the foundation's textbook whatever you have on hand. So, to treat the ACL we're going to use a third osteopathic arm of a pillow and we're going to place it behind the femur, then we're going to push the tibia posterior. So now we're going to draw a picture so you can get an idea of how this treatment position would work. So, here's the femur from the lateral side, here's the tibia from the lateral side and here's the patella on the anterior portion of the knee. You have the ACL running from the anterior portion of the tibia to the posterior femur and you have the PCL posterior tibia going to the anterior femur. So, if you place a pillow behind the femur and then you push the tibia posteriorly, you're going to bring the two ends of the ACL closer together. That's going to be your counterstrain treatment position for the ACL. So, the PCL attaches in the opposite places of the ACL. So, what do you think the treatment position will be? The opposite. So, you're going to put the pillow behind the tibia and you're going to push the femur posterior. So, your pillow is going to go behind the tibia, you're going to push the femur posteriorly, that's going to bring both edges closer together, that's your counterstrain treatment point. So, the next two muscles we're going to compare together are the piriformis and the glutes. So, we already discussed the piriformis, the origin and insertion and what the muscle typically does, which is lower extremity external rotation. We talked about how to treat with muscle energy, but you can also treat it with counterstrain. The treatment position is going to be the position of these for the muscle, which as you'll recall will be external rotation. If you need to get the pain scale below 3 out of 10, you can add in slight abduction and slight flexion. So, comparing that to the glutes. The glutes are the primary hip extensors of your body. So, the position of ease of the glutes is going to be hip extension, countering treatment position, hip extension and if you need to readjust to get the pain below 3 out of 10, you can add abduction and you can also add external rotation. So, the final two we're going to have the PSOAS and the Iliacus. Now remember we already went over so PSOAS back in the lumbar lesson. So, if you recall this is the one where the tender point is two-thirds the distance between the ASIS and umbilicus. So, two-thirds, ASIS and umbilicus. So, what was the primary motion of the PSOAS? It was flexion, external rotation and slight side bending towards, so what do you think the counterstrain position will be? What the muscle can do? So, flexion, external rotation and side bending towards. Now the iliacus is pretty similar to the PSOAS in terms of function and where the tender point will be. The iliacus tender point is one-third the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus. So, one-third ASIS and umbilicus. Since the muscle movement is also pretty similar compared to the PSOAS the treatment position will also be pretty similar. So, it will be flexion, external rotation and instead of side bending towards, we're going to add abduction of the lower extremity. So, we went over a lot in this lesson. We talked about the Spencer technique for the hip and the mnemonic Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin to help you remember the barriers. The important muscle piriformis along with the sciatic nerve clinical correlate. The locations of all of the ligaments of the knee and where you would be able to palpate the structures as well as where the patient may have pain and we brought a lot back home were some counterstrain and that's OMM for the lower extremity part 1. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Hip Area and Knee]  
﻿Now we're going to talk about OMM for the lower extremity. This series is just going to be split into two videos. This first video, we're going to go over the Spencer technique for the hip, the important muscle piriformis, the ligaments of the knee, and of course, some counterstrain points. So we're going to start off with Spencer for the hip. So just like the Spencer technique for the shoulder, you're going to have multiple steps for the Spencer technique of the hip. So in order to memorize this, come up with another pneumonic that we can use. Felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So remember, felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So these letters represent the barriers that we are going to place the patient into for treatment. So the first one is flexion barrier, then you have extension, then you have compression with circumduction, then you have traction with circumduction, then you have internal rotation, external rotation, AB duction, and then AD duction. All of these motions that you can do with the lower extremity flexed in order to get the motion correct. Another way to look at this is if you notice, every two barriers are opposite of one another. Flexion extension, compression traction, internal external, AB duct AD duct. So remember, felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So now we're going to talk about the piriformis. This muscle comes up on just about every single OMM exam that I've ever taken. So we're going to spend some time to talk about it. So the piriformis origin is on the posterior side of the sacrum. The insertion is on the greater tubercle of the femur. So if we think about concepts in anatomy, what do you think the piriformis is going to do? It attaches on the sacrum, inserts at the greater trochanter. So if we think about the origin and insertion, we can get an idea of the motion that the piriformis does. When the muscle contracts, it brings both ends closer together, and to do that the lower extremity must externally rotate. So the piriformis causes lower extremity external rotation. So function is lower extremity external rotation. So what about when it's dysfunctional? So think about this. When the piriformis is dysfunctional, it's going to be hypertonic. It's going to be contracted and stuck in that position. So it's going to keep both ends of the muscle closer together. What does that mean? It means that the leg is externally rotated. So when it's dysfunctional, you're going to see an external rotation of the lower extremity. Now here's a clinical correlate that always pops up on exams. You have to remember anatomically that the sciatic nerve comes out right below the piriformis. If the piriformis is dysfunctional and hypertonic, it can begin to compress the sciatic nerve. And when that happens, the patient will have lower extremity paresthesias, potentially some burning and shooting pain. So if you see something like that in a clinic or on an exam, they might be trying to tell you to take a look at the piriformis and see if it's dysfunctional. So to keep that in your head I'm going to put sciatic nerve. So how are we going to treat this? There's a couple different ways to treat the piriformis, but the first one that we're going to go over is muscle energy. So thinking back to the beginning about how you do muscle energy, you put the muscle into the restrictive barrier where it cannot go. You have the patient flex into the freedom or where it can go. You do that multiple times, bring them back to neutral, rescreen. So the thing that you need to know for the piriformis is, where is the restrictive barrier and what motion do they need to do to go into the freedom? We already wrote it down. When it's dysfunctional, it can externally rotate. So what we're going to do to engage the barrier for muscle energy treatment is to internally rotate. So then what motion are we going to have the patient do isometrically in order to move into the freedom? We get them to do what the muscle can do, which is external rotation. So when treating with muscle energy, you always engage the restrictive barrier passively and then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom. Once that the treatment's over, you're going to bring the patient back to neutral and rescreen. So we're going to leave piriformis behind and we're going to begin to talk about some of the ligaments of the knee. And to do that, we're going to draw a picture. So this is going to be your femur, and this is going to represent your tibia. Your fibula will be on this side to show you that this is lateral and this is medial. So there are four big structures that we need to talk about that are located in the knee. The first structures are on the medial side of the knee, and that's going to be your MCL, your medial collateral ligament, and your medial meniscus. So they're going to be located medial meniscus, MCL. Don't worry about getting into the nitty gritty of what they attach to, where they are, what the function is. That's for your anatomy course. Just understand that they're located on the medial side of the knee and they help with knee stability. So next, the lateral side of the knee, we're going to see the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus. So it's just going to be on the opposite side. So you have the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus. Two more ligaments, and both are going to be noticed from the posterior side. You have the anterior collateral ligament, which attaches to the anterior side of the tibia and the posterior side of the femur. You also have the posterior collateral ligament. The posterior collateral ligament attaches to the posterior side of the tibia and the anterior side of the femur. The reasons that we're going over these ligaments is so that you can get an idea of some counterstrain treatments of these ligaments. So if the patient is having pain in their medial knee and you find a tender point there, you'll probably want to treat the MCL. Lateral side, you're going to think about the LCL, and if you're palpating on the posterior side of the knee, you're going to have to think about the ACL and the PCL. So we're going to go ahead and discuss what the counterstrain positions are for these ligaments and some other important muscles of the lower extremity. So counterstrain. You already know how to do this treatment. I think that we've beaten it to death. It's indirect. You bring the two ends of the muscle closer together. You fold and hold. It's that simple. So if you have a tender point located on the medial side of the knee, you need to think about the MCL and the medial meniscus. If you're going to bring the two ends of the MCL together, you're going to flex, AD duct and internally rotate. So you're going to flex the knee joint, you're going to AD duct the tibia, so bring it closer to the body, which will then bring the tibia closer to the femur on the medial side, and then you will internally rotate the tibia. That's going to bring the two ends of the MCL closer together for your treatment position. We're going to compare that to the LCL and the lateral meniscus. They're located on the lateral side of the knee, so you're going to have to do the opposite that you would for the MCL. You're still going to flex, but you're going to AB duct and externally rotate. So you're going to flex the knee joint, AB duct the tibia away from the body, which will bring it closer to the femur on the lateral side, and then you're going to externally rotate the tibia to bring the two ends of the LCL closer together. So now we're going to compare those to the posterior tender points. On the posterior side, you'll have the ACL and the PCL. So for these two treatments, we're going to have to bring a friend to the party. We're going to have to use what we call the third osteopathic arm. Basically, whatever you have laying around to help you with the treatment. So in this one, we're going to use a pillow as an example. So for the ACL, you need to bring this anterior attachment on the tibia and the posterior attachment on the femur closer together. And the way that you're going to do that is place a pillow on the posterior side of the femur and then posteriorly push the tibia. So imagine this. You have the patient laying on their back. You have a pillow underneath the femur and you are pushing down on the tibia towards the table. That's going to push the tibia posteriorly, which is going to push this attachment closer to the attachment on the femur. The PCL treatment position is the opposite. So we're going to place the pillow under the tibia and we are going to push posteriorly on the femur. This motion will then bring both ends of the PCL closer together. So the next two that we're going to compare, we're going to talk about the piriformis and the glutes. So we already talked about one way to treat the piriformis, which could be muscle energy. If you find a tender point and you want to treat it with counterstrain, you just have to put it into the position of ease or what it can do, which we already discussed. The piriformis externally rotates, so you're going to externally rotate the lower extremity to do the counterstrain position. So for piriformis, your primary motion is going to be externally rotating. If you need to adjust slightly to make sure that you get below three on the pain scale, you can add slight AB duction and slight flexion. What about the glutes? So the glutes are primarily extensors of the hip and the lower extremity. So if you're going to put it into the treatment position that it usually goes in when it's contracted, it's extension. So the treatment position is going to be extension. The rest of the position, if you need to adjust to make sure that you get below three on that pain scale, is the exact same as the piriformis. Externally rotate and AB duction. Primary motion, extension. So two more counterstrain points that we're going to go over. The first one is going to be the psoas muscle, and the second one is going to be iliacus. Now if you remember, we already went over the psoas muscle earlier in the video series. This point is located two-thirds of the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus. It's primarily a hip flexor and it causes side bending towards the dysfunctional side. So what do you think the treatment position is to bring both ends together? Flexion and side bending towards. So just as a reminder, the psoas counterstrain point is two-thirds the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus, and the treatment position is going to be flexion, external rotation and side bending towards the dysfunction. So we're going to compare that to iliacus. The tender point for iliacus is going to be located one-third the distance from the ASIS to the umbilicus. The motion of the iliacus is very similar to that of the psoas. So the treatment position is going to be very similar to the psoas as well. So for this, we're going to remember that it's one-third the distance from the ASIS to the umbilicus, and the treatment position is going to include flexion, external rotation and instead of side bending towards, you're going to AB duct the lower extremity from the side of dysfunction. So in this lecture we went over a lot. We went over the Spencer technique for the hip and the pneumonic "felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin." We went over the always important piriformis muscle, some of the major structures of the knee, and we related that to how to use it, counterstrain points, talked about counterstrain points for piriformis and glutes, psoas and iliacus. That's OMM for the lower extremity, part one. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Innominate Dysfunctions v2]  
﻿Being able to diagnose the innominates should be pretty easy when compared to being able to diagnose the sacrum. You're still going to have to do an exam to figure out the laterality of the dysfunction and you still need to palpate some landmarks but being able to visualize emotions are going to be significantly easier than the sacrum. So, to start off, you have to figure out the laterality of the dysfunction. The way that you do that is by performing the standing flexion test. So, this test is exactly the same as a seated flexion test for the sacrum except instead of having the patient seated, you're going to have the patient standing. So you're going to have the patient stand, hook both of your thumbs underneath the patient's PSIS and as they flex forward, you're going to assess which thumb moves first, farthest or fastest, whichever thumb does that that's the side of the dysfunction and that's what you're going to name the dysfunction based off. So, there are two different tests that you can do for laterality. You can either do the standing flexion test or you can do the ASIS compression test. Now I put or because you don't have to do both exams. You only have to do one. You can choose whichever one you would like to do, but on a practice question, they may only give you the findings for the compression test and you'll need to know that means the same thing as a standing flexion test. The way to do this test, you have the patient lying supine on the table, you're going to place both of your hands on the patient innominates and you're going to push posteriorly, whichever side doesn't move easy or whichever side gives you a hardened feel is a side of the dysfunction. So, if it's dysfunctional on the right, it's going to be very difficult to compress down. So, once you figure out the laterality, you need to palpate some landmarks. The landmarks that you need to palpate are going to be the ASIS, the PSIS and the pubic tubercle. So, the ASIS is the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine. That's the bony landmark on the anterior surface of the innominates. The PSIS is the Posterior Superior Iliac Spine located on the posterior side of the Innominate. The PT is the Pubic Tubercle, you're going to palpate that on the anterior side of the abdomen going down low near the pubic area. So, when you palpate these findings, it's going to give you an idea of motion that the innominates are performing. The ASIS findings can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. Your PSIS findings can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. And your pubic tubercle findings can either be superior, or inferior. So superior or inferior to what? You're going to be comparing these landmarks bilaterally to one another. So, you're going to be comparing the right ASIS to the left ASIS. For example, if the right ASIS is superior, that means it's higher up than the left ASIS. Now there are three different dysfunctions that you can have for the innominates. You can either have a rotation, a shear, or you can have a flare. So, the first type of dysfunction is a rotation. These are really simple to visualize. Imagine that you are palpating the patient's sacrum and you're looking from the posterior side a rotation is simply the innominate rotating. It can either be an anterior rotation, where it goes forward or it can be a posterior rotation, where it goes backward. So, innominate anterior-posterior rotation. So, what are your landmark findings going to be for these diagnoses? We're going to look at the ASIS, the PSIS, we are also going to take a look at leg length, the cause and some treatments. So, for an anterior rotation, your ASIS will be inferior on the side of the dysfunction, your PSIS will be superior on the side of the dysfunction and that will be an anterior rotation. Now when you anteriorly rotate the inanimate, it's going to push the rest of the anatomy downward thus creating a long leg for the patient. So, if the patient has an anterior rotation, they may have a long leg on presentation. So, what's one cause of an anterior innominate rotation? Hypertonic muscles, so the muscle that attaches to the anterior portion of the innominates is your quads. When your quads become hypertonic, it can pull the anterior portion of the pelvis forward thus creating an anterior rotation. So, if you have dysfunctional quads, you may have an anterior rotation. Now the way that you're going to treat this if you want to target a muscle for muscle energy, you're going to work on a muscle that attaches to the posterior side to help pull the innominate back in a neutral. That muscle is going to be your hamstrings. So, if you want to treat an interior rotation with muscle energy, you'll target the hamstrings. Now a posterior rotation is basically the exact opposite of an anterior. So, the ASIS on the side of the dysfunction will be superior. The PSIS on the side of the dysfunction will be inferior. With a posterior rotation the anatomy will be pulled upward thus creating a short leg and it's going to be the opposite cause and treatment muscles for the rotation. So, one muscle that will cause a posterior rotation is the hamstrings and one muscle that you can use to treat a posterior rotation is the quads. So, the next dysfunctions are going to be the shear dysfunctions. You can have an up-shear, a down-sheer, a pubic up-shear and a pubic down-shear. The landmarks that you're going to be palpating are the ASIS, PSIS, the pubic tubercle and we're going to mention the leg length again. So, what's an up-shear and a down-shear? If you're holding the patient's innominates, an up-shear is just going up up-shear down-shear down, that's it. So, your landmark findings for an up-shear everything's going to be up. So, you're going to have a superior ASIS on the side of the dysfunction, superior PSIS and a superior pubic tubercle. Now imagine if you have an up-shear it's going to pull all the anatomy upward that's going to cause a short leg on the side of the dysfunction, so short. Down-shear going down is going to be the opposite. So, your findings will be the opposite. ASIS on the side of the dysfunction will be down, PSIS will be down and the pubic tubercle will also be down. If you're pushing the anatomy downward for a shear, the anatomy will go down and you'll have a long leg. So, what about a pubic up-shear and down-shear? It's little bit interesting for these the only finding that you're going to have is on the pubic tubercle. So, you're not going to have any dysfunctional locations for ASIS or PSIS, but your pubic tubercle will be superior on a pubic up-shear. On a pubic down-shear, no ASIS or PSIS findings, but your pubic tubercle will be inferior on the side of the dysfunction. So, the final type of dysfunction for the innominates are flares. You can either have an in-flare or an out-flare. Now an in-flare or an out-flare basically means that the innominate is curled inward or outward. So, an in-flare looking from the top down, the ASIS will curl medially. For an out-flare the ASIS will curl laterally. So, your landmark findings will be your ASIS and your PSIS. For an in-flare it's going to be medial for the ASIS and the PSIS you'll either have no findings or will be lateral. For an out-flare your ASIS will be lateral and your PSIS will either have no findings or will be medial. So, let's go over some practice questions to really hammer this back home. So, for the first one, you're going to have a positive standing flexion test on the right, an ASIS inferior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. So, you have two options. You can either have a memory of all of the different findings or you can use the cowabunga hands. cowabunga hand is just a visual representation of the inanimate motion, where your thumbs will represent your PSIS findings and your pinkies will be the ASIS findings. So, your findings are a right standing flexion test being positive, the right ASIS being inferior on the right side and to show that you can rotate your hand forward. This also has your PSIS being superior on the right, which is also a finding. So now that you're in this motion, you can really easily tell that you have a right anterior rotation, which is your diagnosis. So right anterior rotation. So, question 2. You have a compression test that's positive on the left, an ASIS that's inferior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. Now remember, you need to have the landmark findings on the side of the dysfunction. So, when you're doing the cowabunga hands or your writing it out, you need to make sure that you can flip your findings to the other side. For example, if the right ASIS is superior, that's the same thing as saying that the left ASIS is inferior. So, when you're doing the cowabunga hands for this question, the compression test being positive on the left tells you that the left side is dysfunctional. The right ASIS is inferior. So, you can rotate your right hand to show this and you're right PSIS is superior, because you need to know the findings of the dysfunctional side, which is the left side, you need to rotate your right hand back to neutral and rotate your left hand the same amount. This will now show that the findings on the right side are in neutral and the left side is dysfunctional. This now shows you that you have a left posterior innominate rotation, which is the correct answer. So left posterior rotation. So, question 3. You have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right. An ASIS that's superior on the right and a PSIS that's also superior on the right. So cowabunga hands, right hand dysfunctional, right ASIS and PSIS are both superior. So, this shows you that you have a right up- shear. So right up-shear. Next question, you have a positive compression test on the left. An ASIS that's superior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. cowabunga hands, right ASIS and PSIS are both superior, but the dysfunctions on the left side because of the left compression test being positive. So, this will easily show you that you have a left down-shear, because the left side is now down. So, you have a left down-shear. Question 5, you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right and an ASIS that is medial on the right. PSIS you have no findings. So cowabunga hands, right ASIS is now more medial and this will show you a right in-flare, you're curling inward. So, you have a right in-flare and for the final question, you have a compression test that's positive on the left. You have an ASIS that's equal on both sides, PSIS that's equal on both sides and a pubic tubercle that's superior on the right and you can't really use the cowabunga hands for a pubic shear, but these are pretty easy to find out. ASIS and PSIS you have no findings. So pubic tubercle is going to be what you base the diagnosis on. Pubic tubercle is superior on the right, but the compression test is positive on the left. So, the left side is dysfunctional, because the right side is higher, that means that the left side is lower, which means that you have a left pubic down-shear. So, we went over how to diagnose the innominates in this lecture. The first step is to either perform the standing flexion test or ASIS compression test to find which side is dysfunctional, you need to palpate your landmarks, you need to figure out if it's a rotation, shear or flare dysfunction and we went over some practice questions to make sure that you got it and that's OMM for the innominates. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Innominate Dysfunctions]  
﻿Being able to diagnose the innominates is pretty simple when you compare it to being able to diagnose the sacrum. You only need to know where the landmarks are in relation to one another to get the question correct. In this lecture, I'm going to walk you through how to get the correct diagnosis based on where the landmarks are. We're going to use a simple hand gesture to get the correct diagnosis. Then at the very end I'm going to include a flow chart for people that like flow charts. So if you take a look at the picture, on the anterior side of the innominate you have the anterior superior iliac spine or the ASIS. On the posterior side of the innominate, you have the posterior superior iliac spine, or the PSIS. Back on the anterior portion of the innominate, you have the public tubercle. You're going to use these three landmarks in order to get your innominate diagnosis. So we're going to use those landmarks to get the correct diagnosis for the innominates. So the first thing that you need is the standing flexion test. Now the standing flexion test is basically the same test as the seated flexion test, except instead of having the patient seated, they're going to be standing up. So don't get confused between the seated flexion test and the standing flexion test. The seated flexion test is only for the sacrum. The standing flexion test is for the innominates. So what we're going to do is have the patient standing. We're going to hook our thumbs below the PSIS and have the patient bend forward into flexion. As they go into flexion, one of our thumbs is either going to move first, furthest or fastest. Whichever side does that is going to be your positive side. That's going to be the side of dysfunction, and that's what you're going to name the diagnosis from. A test that's similar to the standing flexion test is called the ASIS compression test. This test tells you the same thing as the standing flexion test. It just says which side is positive. The way you perform this test is you have the patient laying on their back, supine, and you take both hands and you push posteriorly on the ASIS. Whichever side is more mobile is going to be the positive side, the positive compression test. You can compress it more. So then back to landmark anatomy for what you need to make the diagnosis. You have the ASIS, and there are four different findings that you can have for the ASIS. It can either be superior, it can be inferior, or it can be medial or lateral. All of these findings are in relation to the ASIS on the other innominate bone. So if the ASIS on the right side is superior, that means that the ASIS on the left side is inferior. Now the next landmark is the PSIS, and you can have the exact same findings for that. It can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. So these are once again in relation to the other innominate PSIS. So if the PSIS on the left is inferior, that means that the PSIS on the right is superior. The last landmark that you have is the pubic tubercle. The pubic tubercle can either be superior or inferior in relation to the other. So if one is inferior, the other is superior. So there are three different types of dysfunctions that you can have for the innominates. You can have rotations, shears and flares. So we're going to go over rotations first. The rotational dysfunction means that one of the innominates is rotated further than the other. You can either have an anterior rotation, meaning that it tips interiorly, or you can have a posterior rotation, meaning that it tips posteriorly in relation to the other. So if you have an anterior rotation, you're going to have these landmark findings. Your ASIS is going to be inferior on the side of the standing flexion test. Your PSIS is going to be superior on the side of the standing flexion test. When you have an anterior rotation, you are also going to have a longer leg on that side. So think about this anatomically. If the innominate is rotated anteriorly, you are pushing the rest of the bones downward, so you're creating a long leg. So what's one item that can cause this dysfunction? You can have hypertonic quads. So think about the anatomically. Your quads are on the anterior portion of your thigh. They attach to the anterior portion of your innominate. If they're hypertonic, they're going to yank down the rest of the innominate, causing a forward bending or an anterior rotation. So then how do you treat it? You're going to do the opposite. So what are the antagonist muscles to the quads? You have the hamstrings. So the hamstrings are located on the posterior side of the innominate. If you need to pull the rest of the innominate back into posterior rotation, you're going to treat the hamstrings with muscle energy. You're going to activate the hamstrings, pull that anteriorly rotated innominate back posterior. So you're going to treat with the hamstrings. The quads can cause an anterior rotation, you're going to fix it with the hamstrings. So now you have a posterior rotation. Basically the exact opposite of an anterior rotation, so you're ASIS is going to be superior on the side of the standing flexion test, your PSIS is going to be inferior on the side of the standing flexion test. You're going to have a short leg. It can be caused by the hamstrings and you can treat it with the quads. It's the exact opposite of the anterior rotation. So you have anterior and you have posterior. So I'm going to leave a gap here so we can come into some practice questions a little later on. But the next type of dysfunction that you can have is a shear. Now a shear is basically where one of the innominates is located either superiorly or inferiorly compared to the other side. So you can have a superior shear or an up shear, or you can have a down shear or an inferior shear. So what are your findings going to be for those? So for an up shear, you're going to have an ASIS that is superior on the side of the standing flexion test. You're going to have a PSIS that is also superior on the side of the standing flexion test. And you may even have finding of the pubic tubercle, which would also be superior on the same side as the standing flexion test. So how do we relate this to the leg? Imagine that you have an innominate that's up higher. It's going to pull the rest of the bones with it, so you can imagine that you're going to have a short leg on that side. So short leg. So if you have an up shear, that means that you can also have a down shear. In a down shear, the findings are exactly the opposite as an up shear. So you have an ASIS that is inferior on the side of the positive standing flexion test. PSIS that's also inferior, and a pubic tubercle that is also inferior. The leg length is going to be long. So imagine that the bones are being moved downward, you're going to have a long leg. There are two other types of shears that you can have. You can have a pubic up shear and you can have a pubic down shear. So you can have two other types of shears. You can have a pubic up shear and a pubic down shear. So these findings are very easy to point out. Your pubic tubercle on a pubic up shear will be superior. On a pubic down shear, your pubic tubercle will be inferior. But what about ASIS and PSIS? They're not going to have any landmark findings. So it's only going to be the pubic tubercle that has something. Same thing with a down shear. ASIS, PSIS nothing. Pubic tubercle will be down for a down shear on the side of dysfunction. And the last type of dysfunction that you can have in the innominates is a flare. There are two types. You can either have an in flare or an out flare. That means that one innominate bone is either tilted more inward as an in flare or tilted more outward as an out flare. So for these findings, in flare, your ASIS is going to be medial on the side of dysfunction, and your PSIS will either have no findings at all or will be lateral. And for an out flare, on the theme of being opposite, it's going to be the exact opposite. So you have an out flare, your ASIS is going to be lateral on the same side as your standing flexion test being positive, and your PSIS is either not going to have any findings or it's going to be more medial. So now I have all the findings. How am I going to be able to use this to get the diagnosis without memorizing all these tiny points? This is where the cowabunga hand is going to come in handy. So let's go ahead and write down a practice question. So for number one, we're going to have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right. An ASIS that is inferior on the right, and a PSIS that is superior on the right. So this is where your cowabunga hands are going to come into play. You hold them directly in front of you. Your thumbs are going to be the PSIS and your pinkies will be the ASIS. So what you're going to do is you're going to use the anatomic findings in order to get the correct diagnosis. So for these dysfunctions, remember that you always name the side of the standing flexion test for your diagnosis. So all of your diagnostic findings need to be on that side in order to get the cowabunga hands to work properly. So in this example, the standing flexion test is positive on the right side. The ASIS is located inferiorly on the right compared to the left. So I'm just going to twist my hand forward, so now the pinkie is lower than the other pinkie. The PSIS on the right side is superior on the right, more superior than the PSIS is on the left, which is still where I'm holding my hand. So if I'm looking at this, I can already tell that the right innominate is anteriorly rotated. So the answer is right anterior rotation. So then the second question. Let's say that you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the left, an ASIS that's inferior on the right and a PSIS that is superior on the right. So I just use my cowabunga hands once again. You have a positive standing flexion test on the left. So you're going to name everything based on the left side, which is the abnormal side. On the right you have an inferior ASIS but a superior PSIS. Now the findings are on the other side than the standing flexion test. The standing flexion test is the dysfunction side and the abnormal side, so you have to reverse it. So you move your fingers back into the regular anatomic position, so that now my right side, which is normal, is back in the normal plane and the left side is now dysfunctional. So now when I'm looking at my hand, I can tell that my left side has rotated posteriorly. So the answer is a left posterior rotation. So the next practice question. You have a compression test that's positive on the left and an ASIS that is inferior on the right and a PSIS that is inferior on the left. So remember, the compression test is the same thing as a standing flexion test. This just tells you that your findings are abnormal on the left side. So you need to relate all of the findings back to the left innominate. So your ASIS is inferior on the right side, so you rotate your right hand downward to get your pinkie inferior. The PSIS is inferior on the left side, so you rotate your hand left. So to get the diagnosis, you have to bring your right hand back to neutral because the left side is dysfunctional. So now you have your hands like this, you can tell that your left hand is posteriorly rotated. So you have a left posterior rotation. So let's do some practice questions for shears. So the first question, your standing flexion test is positive on the right. Your ASIS is superior on the right, and your PSIS is superior on the right. So if you're doing your cowabunga hands once again, you have to make sure that all of your findings are on the side of dysfunction, which for this example is going to be for the right. So now using the cowabunga hands, you have your standing flexion test that's positive on the right, which means that all of your diagnostic findings will be on this side. Your ASIS is superior on the right, and your PSIS is also superior on the right. So using this motion, you can tell that the right side is up. So you have a right up shear. Right up shear. Next question, standing flexion test positive on the right. ASIS is superior on the left, PSIS is superior on the left. So using your hands, the right side is dysfunctional. Left ASIS is up, left PSIS is up. Your findings are on the right side, so the right is dysfunctional. If you're looking at it, the right is now lower than the left. The answer is a right down shear. The final shear practice question, you have an ASIS compression test that's positive on the left. You have a pubic tubercle that is superior on the right. You have an ASIS finding of being normal and a PSIS finding of being normal. You can't really use the cowabunga hands for a pubic up shear or down shear. Just memorize it if the pubic tubercle is up and everything's normal, it's pubic up shear. If it's down, pubic down shear. So for this one, you've got a pubic up shear. So now some questions for a flare. You have the standing flexion test that's positive on the right, and you have an ASIS that is medial on the right. So cowabunga hands. Positive on the right side. You're right ASIS is more medial. So when you're doing this motion, you can tell that your right side is going inward, so this is an in flare on the right. So a right in flare. So the standing flexion test is going to be positive on the left and your ASIS is going to be medial on the right. Back to using your hands. The left side is dysfunctional. The right ASIS is located more medial. But you have to bring it back out to neutral so that it makes sense. So when you bring it to neutral, you're going to show that now the left side is an out flare. So bringing it back into neutral. So a left out flare. So if the cowabunga hands made sense to you then you don't really have to worry about anything else and the lecture's over. But if you're the type of person that likes a flow chart and just wants to be able to take the points that are given to you and plug it in somewhere to get the answer, we're going to do a quick flow chart for that. So in order to do that, so the first thing that you're going to do is compare the direction of the ASIS and PSIS on the same side as one another. So your ASIS can either be superior or inferior, and your PSIS can be superior or inferior. If you've noticed, for shears, the ASIS and PSIS are both superior or, for a down shear, the ASIS and PSIS are both going inferiorly on the same side. If you have a rotation that's anterior, the ASIS and PSIS are both located on the same side but pointing in opposite directions. For posterior rotation, the ASIS and PSIS are pointing in different directions but on the same side. So if we're going to use that for our flow chart, you're going to assess which direction the ASIS and PSIS are both pointing on the same side. So if they are both pointing superior or both pointing inferior on the same side, you're going to have a shear. Now if on the same side the ASIS and PSIS are pointed in opposite directions, that's going to tell you that you have some sort of a rotation dysfunction. So the next thing that you're going to do is compare the standing flexion test and the side of the superior ASIS. So if you're on the shear side, you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the same side that the ASIS is superior, you're going to have an up shear. If it's located on opposite sides, so let's say the standing flexion test is positive on the left but the superior ASIS is located on the right, that means that you're going to have a down shear. So now looking back at rotations, you're going to do the same next step. You're going to compare the standing flexion test versus the side of the superior ASIS. If the standing flexion test is positive on the same side as the superior ASIS, you're going to have a posterior rotation. If the side of the superior ASIS is on the opposite of the side of the positive standing flexion test, you're going to have an anterior rotation. So we went over two different methods of diagnosing the innominates during this lecture. We went over the cowabunga hands and we went over the chart. The only other thing that you need to do is assess which side the standing flexion test is positive, the ASIS location, the PSIS location, and the pubic tubercle location. And that's how you diagnose the innominates. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to Counterstrain]  
﻿This section is difficult and it's not very fun to learn. It's called counterstrain. The treatment of counterstrain tender points is pretty simple, but knowing the hundreds of different positions and knowing the exact setup for everything gets pretty complicated and pretty convoluted. So in this lecture, I'm going to teach you the high yield stuff that you have to know to get the questions correct using an advanced organizer, and explain to you that maybe you don't necessarily need to remember all the spots if you remember just to fold and hold. So let's go ahead and start with tender point. So a tender point is what you're going to be treating with counterstrain. A tender point is a hypertonic portion of muscle that is tender when you poke it. It doesn't radiate, it's a tender point. So hypertonic. Now how do you get a tender point to treat? What happens is you stretch a muscle too fast. An example of this would be you're in a car, you're at a red light, you get rear ended from behind. And when that happens, your neck extends very quickly and you get the whiplash motion. All the muscles in the front side of your neck are stretching way too fast than what they usually do. This is going to send a signal to your muscle spindle fibers. They're stretching too fast, they're going to get injured if they keep stretching this fast. So there is a reflex arc that says, slow down, contract the muscle. And when that happens, your muscle is then going to contract forcefully. So in our whiplash example, you get hit from behind, extend your neck in the whiplash, muscle spindle fibers get activated, tell you to flex your neck forcefully. And now, this is where the tender point will be, the anterior cervical area. Muscles are too contracted. So how do we treat this? When you're doing the treatment, it's very important to follow every single step exactly the same. What they will test you on in exam is making sure that you're following the steps exactly how they should be. So any counterstrain point, you have to treat it the same. So as we mentioned in the previous lecture, counterstrain is an indirect treatment, meaning that you put it into the freedom, you put it into the position of ease. So in our whiplash example, if the muscles on the anterior side of the neck are flexed and contracted, that means it is easy for them to flex but it's very difficult to go back into extension. So if I put it into flexion or into the freedom, that's indirect. So indirect and passive. And again, passive means that the patient does not participate in the treatment. The practitioner is moving them for themselves. So then what? You need to find the tender point and then you need to poke it and make the pain scale. So you find the tender point on the front of the patient's neck, you push on it and you ask them, how painful is that? And they're going to tell you it hurts ten out of ten, whatever. Whatever they say, you need to tell the patient that during the treatment, that pain that you're feeling right now is going to be considered a ten out of ten. So the next part is to passively move the patient into the treatment position. Now that you're in this position, you're going to poke the tender point again, and you're going to ask how painful is it? And they're going to tell you it's decreased. You ask where it is on the pain scale, and if they said it is three or less, you know that you're in the correct position for treatment. If they say anything other than three or less, you need to readjust your position to make sure the pain is less than three. Once you're here, you need to hold this position for 90 seconds. Once you hold for 90 seconds, then you can return the patient back to neutral. Once they're back in neutral, you continue to poke on the area and ask how is it now? Is it still painful? So you're rescreening to see if your treatment worked. An important part of this treatment is to know where you place your finger and when to lift it up. So once you find the tender point, you poke on the point. You keep your finger on the tender point. Once they give you the pain scale, you keep your finger on the point but you release pressure, so you're just monitoring. Move them to passive, reassess pain by adding pressure and poking on it, keep the finger on the point to monitor, hold for 90 seconds, passive to neutral, and then you can rescreen by poking on it. During the entire treatment, you never lift up your finger. You just adjust the pressure that you're putting on it. So now that you know the steps to treatment, we're going to go over some of the high yield points for you to know in the cervical spine, thoracic, lumbar and ribs. So you have anterior and posterior points. Anterior cervical, anterior thoracic, anterior lumbar and anterior ribs. And the organizer that we're going to use is going to be SARA. We're going to get really familiar with SARA during this talk. So we're going to write out SR for all the spots. Now calling back to the previous lectures, S and R mean side bending and rotation. All that we need to fill in is a directionality for each treatment point. So like I said, we're going to get very familiar with SARA. So any of the anterior cervical points, you're going to side bend away and rotate away. For the thoracic spine, it's going to be a little bit different. So you're going to rotate away but you're going to side bend towards. For anterior lumbar, you take the thoracic and you flip it. So you got side bend away and rotate towards. And then you got ribs. Ribs are different. They're not part of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. So they're going to be different than SARA. They're going to be side bend toward, rotate toward. Now what does toward and away mean? Each of these points can be located midline or lateral. When you're treating the lateral points on the right side and you want to side bend away, rotate away, you're going to side bend to the left and rotate to the left. If you want to side bend and rotate toward the right, side bend toward the right, rotate toward the right. That's treatment position. So the last component is the flexion and extension. Like I said earlier, fold and hold is going to be the easy way to remember all these. And since this is all anterior, how do you fold up the front? You go into flexion. So these are the basic anterior points for you to know. Now you need to learn the posterior. So you have posterior cervical, posterior thoracic, posterior lumbar and posterior ribs. For the posterior points, it's important to delineate between midline and lateral points. So cervical, you have a midline point and a lateral point. For thoracic you have a midline and lateral. We'll go over midline in a second. So let's just worry about lateral. For lumbar, you have a midline and a lateral, and for ribs you don't have midline or lateral. So now going back to our SARA pneumonic, she really helps us out a lot for the posterior side, because all of them are going to be side bend away, rotate away. The final portion is flexion or extension. So if it's in the back and you want to fold and hold those back muscles, you're going to extend. Now just like the anterior points and ribs being very different, just like that for posterior. The posterior point is going to be very different. So instead of extension, you're going to go into flexion. So these are all the normal points for the cervical spine, thoracic, lumbar and for the ribs of the anterior and posterior sides. So going over the organizer again, if it's anterior you always flex it to fold and hold. For cervical spine, SARA's our friend. Side bend away, rotate away. For thoracic spine, you side bend towards and rotate away. Lumbar you flip it, so you side bend away, rotate toward, and ribs are totally different. So you side bend toward, rotate toward. For the posterior points, you always extend except for ribs, which are weird, they flex. And the rest of them SARA is still our friend, so you side bend away and you rotate away. So now you have what we call the maverick points. They don't follow the fold and hold rules very well. So during an exam, it's more likely that you're going to get asked about a maverick point instead of one of these points. These are really easy to memorize, fold and hold. The mavericks take a little bit more memorization. So the first point is going to be anterior cervical 1. This point is located right behind the mandible, up high near the ear, AC1. Now it's AC1, there's only one motion, and it's going to be rotate away. One motion. So don't worry about flexion, don't worry about extension, don't worry about side bending. One motion, rotate away. The next point is going to be AC7. AC7 is located at the sternoclavicular joint, the SC joint. This is where your SCM attaches to your clavicle and sternum. When you think about what motion does the SCM do, it side bends towards and rotates away to shorten the muscle. So using fold and hold, if you want to shorten that muscle, you're going to do what it does. So you are going to flex, side bend toward and rotate away. Another way to remember this is that this motion is just like the thoracic spine, flex, side bend toward, rotate away. If it helps, just remember thoracic spine minus one vertebra, and now you're at AC7. So flex, side bend toward, rotate away. The next maverick point is going to be anterior thoracic points 1 through 6. Now when you're doing these points, there's only one motion that you need to do. It's located on the anterior side, flex forward. So all you do is flex. No side bending, no rotation, flex. Next you have the anterior lumbar points. You have the AL1 and AL5. Now where are these located? These are located on the ASIS in the AIIS. So if you're looking at a picture of where these would be, you can imagine this is the sacrum, this is your hip bone, the ASIS is located up top and the AIIS is located more inferior. So when I'm palpating these structures, AL1 is going to be located at the ASIS, point 2 is going to be located medial to the AIIS, point 3 is lateral and point 4 is inferior. Point 5 is located on the pubic tubercle. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ASIS, AIIS, pubic tubercle. So going back to how to treat AL1, the position is going to be just like AC7. So you're going to flex, you're going to side bend towards, and you're going to rotate away. So just how one of our organizers was AC7 is thoracic spine minus one, you can remember AL1 is thoracic spine plus one. So AL1, flex, side bend toward, rotate away. Then you have AL5, which was located on the pubic tubercle. This treatment position is going to be F, side bend away and rotate away. I'll let you make up your own pneumonic for that one. So then you have the maverick points for the posterior side. You have posterior cervical point 1, located in the midline. So just like AC1, this midline point of number 1 is going to have one motion, and it's going to be flexion. No side bending, no rotation, just flexion. Maverick point because since it's on the posterior side and you're thinking of fold and hold, you'd want to extend. But for this point you flex. Next point is going to be posterior cervical point 3, located in the midline. Now this one, SARA's going to be your friend again. So F, side bend away and rotate away. So this is maverick because it's on the posterior side and you want to extend, but in reality you flex. So it's maverick. F, side bend away, rotate away. So then you have posterior thoracic midline points. So all of the points in the midline for posterior thoracic are going to be treated this way. The way that you treat these is extension. You don't do anything else. No rotation, no side bending, just extension. Easy to remember that because it's on the posterior side and you want to shorten the muscles there, you're just going to extend. It's a maverick point because there's no side bending and no rotation. Last point is going to be your posterior rib point for number 1, for rib number 1. The way that you treat this is you are going to put the patient into extension, you're going to side bend away, and you're going to rotate towards. So some of these points you just have to memorize. I don't have a pneumonic for it. So posterior rib point 1, E, side bend away, rotate toward. You just got to memorize it. So we're going to close out this lecture by discussing the difference between tender points and trigger points. They both don't have anything to do with each other, other than they both start with the letter T so they can be confused by students very easily. So there's differences between trigger points and tender points. So a tender point is what we've been talking about this entire time. It's a singular point. Now when you poke it, the pain does not radiate. And the way that you treat a tender point is with counterstrain. A trigger point, which you should be calling a trigger band so that you don't confuse the two with one another, isn't a singular point but it's an entire band that's tight. And when you poke on this band, the pain will radiate. And when you find a trigger band, you're going to treat it with myofascial, which we will discuss in one of the next lectures. So completely different than the rest of the lecture and doesn't help with counterstrain, but still very important to know the difference between a tender point and a trigger band. So during this lecture, we talked all about counterstrain. We went over what a tender point is, how it starts, the exact treatment order, which you must follow every time, the difference between tender and trigger points, and try to give you an advanced organizer for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and rib counterstrain points so that you can get this stuff right. And that's counterstrain. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to OMM v2]  
﻿Learning OMM is a lot like learning a completely new language. You have to understand the basic vocabulary before you can understand everything else that's to come. The way that the OMM course is laid out is in a very specific order. So, you should watch this video lecture series in that specific order. It's so that these concepts and core ideas will start to build on top of one another, so it all makes sense. For you to do well in osteopathy, of course, you need to learn what I'm saying, but you also need to have a deep understanding of the core concepts. When you're taking an exam or you're in the clinic, you're going to see things that you haven't exactly studied before but if you understand the core concepts of osteopathy, you should be able to tackle just about anything that's thrown at you. So, to start off, we'll say what is a dysfunction. So, a dysfunction is simply an abnormal function of normal anatomy. So, let's say that you can typically flex your arm and extend your arm. If you can't flex your arm all the way, that's an abnormal function of the anatomy that's going to be a dysfunction. So, dysfunction is abnormal anatomy. So, how are we going to name these dysfunctions, so that each physician knows what the other physician is talking about? We're going to name them somatic dysfunctions. So, how are we going to name it? This is going to seem pretty weird, but you want to name it by what it can do. Now, you may be thinking that you want to say what the muscle can't do, but it's the opposite. You always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So, in our example for the patient that wasn't able to flex his arm, but he can extend his arm all the way out, this is going to be called an extension dysfunction. He can extend, he cannot flex, it's called an extension dysfunction. So, you always name it a somatic dysfunction by what it can do. Always by what it can do. So, when you're palpating or assessing a somatic dysfunction with your hands, you're going to have different palpatory findings based off if the dysfunction is acute or brand-new, or if it's chronic and it's been lingering around for a while. These different palpatory changes are called your TART findings and TART stands for Texture, Asymmetry, Restriction and Tenderness. So, if you're palpating and assessing an acute dysfunction, the tissue texture may be hot or boggy, or maybe even moist. So, imagine if you just stubbed your toe, it might feel pretty hot if you touch it. It might even feel pretty moist. Acute dysfunction. It just happened. It's hot and burning. Asymmetry, you're going to notice palpable asymmetry on both sides of the dysfunction. For restriction when you ask the patient to move, it's going to be painful on motion. So back to our patient who stubbed his toe, if we ask him to move his toe around, it may be really painful at first. That's going to tell you it's an acute dysfunction. Now, what about tenderness? For tenderness of an acute dysfunction it's going to be sharp pain. Now imagine if you just stubbed your toe, you don't want anyone cramming their fingers on it that's going to hurt, so it's sharp pain. So just remember if you have an acute dysfunction think of these red-hot findings. Now we are going to compare this to a chronic dysfunction. The tissue texture is going to be cool or ropy or maybe even dry. So, if they stub their toe last week and you're going to palpate that toe, it's probably going to feel a little bit cooler than it did when it was an acute injury. You're still going to have palpable asymmetry, but when you ask the patient to move around, they're going to have a decreased pain or maybe they won't have any pain when they move. So, asking the patient to move their stubbed toe that they stabbed last week, it may not be hurtful. So, for tenderness, it's going to feel like dull achy pain. If they stub their toe last week and you're pushing on it, it may just feel dull, because it's starting to heal. So, when you think of chronic dysfunctions, think of cool blue findings and compare that to acute dysfunctions, which would be red-hot findings. So, the next thing that you need to understand our planes and axes of motion and to do that, we're going to draw out some pictures. So, a plane is simply a flat surface and this flat surface is going to be a surface where motion occurs or where you divide the body. There are three different planes that you need to know. The first plane is going to be the sagittal plane. The sagittal plane is going to divide the body right down the bridge of the nose and it's going to split both sides of the body into two equal parts. The next plane is the transverse plane. The transverse plane is going to split the body horizontally. So, if that transverse plane is going from hip to hip, you're going to have a superior side and an inferior side, two different sections. The third plane of motion is going to be your coronal plane. Now imagine that you're wearing a crown, a crown for coronal. It's going to divide your body between an anterior and posterior point going down the ears. So, split your body into an anterior and posterior side. Now this is going to be compared to an access. An access is just a singular point that the body will move around and there are three different axes that you need to be aware of. The first axis is a horizontal axis. It goes horizontally through the body. It's a singular point. So, imagine the pen is the horizontal axis going from hip to hip. It's that singular point. The next axis is a vertical axis that goes vertically through the body. So, the vertical axis will be going from my head to feet and the third axis is an AP axis, or anterior posterior, goes from the anterior to posterior side. Now these axes can be located anywhere on the body. For example, an AP axis could be at the chest, on the foot, in the hand, on the head wherever, you just need to understand that motion will occur around the axis. So, there are three primary motions of the body and we're going to relate those to the planes and axes of motion. The three type of body movements are going to be flexion and extension, rotation and side bending and we are going to talk about how these motions occur on a specific plane and around a specific axis. So, what is flexion and extension. Flexion is just bending forward. It's approximating two ends of whatever joint that you're doing. So, in this example, the joint would be from your chest to your knees. You're bending forward to bring the two ends closer together, that's flexion. Extension is going the opposite direction, bringing both ends further away from one another. So flexion is forward, extension is backward. Now how does this relate to planes and axes of motion? The motion will occur o a plane and around an axis. So, for example think of an umbrella. An umbrella has a handle and a canopy that protects you from the rain. When you twist the handle, it's going to twist the canopy on the top. Now imagine that the handle is your access and the umbrella canopy is your plane of motion. That plane of motion is going around the axis that you're spinning. So, for flexion and extension, it's going to be on a sagittal plane and around a horizontal axis. So using our umbrella example, imagine the umbrella handle is going from hip to hip. When you twist the handle forward that's going to cause flexion and when you twist the handle backward around the axis that's going to cause extension. So, flexion extension on a sagittal plane, but around a horizontal axis. Now rotation is going to be on the transverse plane and on a vertical axis. So back to our umbrella example, imagine that you have a vertical axis. You're twisting the handle and now the body is rotating around that axis. And finally, for side bending that's going to occur on a coronal plane and around an AP axis. So, with the umbrella example again the AP axis going through, you're going to twist the umbrella handle and that's going to cause motion in those directions. So, side bending occurs on a coronal plane around an AP axis. If it helps you remember, think of the colors. Green flexion extension, sagittal horizontal blue and red. The next concept that you need to understand are the barriers of motion. To demonstrate the barrier, I'm going to draw one vertebra looking from the top down and there are different barriers that you need to understand. The first is neutral. Now neutral is where the body anatomy is going to lie when the patient is relaxed or there in neutral. So, if I'm just standing comfortably wherever my spine is is going to be considered neutral. So neutral is in a relaxed position. The next barrier is going to be the physiologic barrier. So, what's this? Imagine that you're rotating your neck, you're using your neck muscles to induce that rotation. However far you can contract your muscles to rotate your head is the physiologic barrier. So, if I'm actively contracting my muscles and I can look over my shoulder and not go any further, that's the physiologic barrier. So active motion or using your own muscles. The next barrier is going to be the anatomic barrier. Now the anatomic barrier is a little bit further than the physiologic barrier. Imagine a physician comes and he tries to rotate your neck. He can probably go just a little bit further than you're able to go by contracting your muscles. That newly found barrier is going to be the anatomic barrier. That's the maximum length that the anatomy can go without causing structural damage. That'll be the anatomic barrier, which you can reach through passive motion. One final barrier that you need to be aware of is the restrictive barrier. Now the restrictive barrier is an abnormal barrier. It's abnormally functioning anatomy. So back to our head turning example, if you can turn your head all the way to the right normally, but when you try and rotate the other direction, it doesn't want to go very far and it stops before the physiologic barrier, that's going to be the restrictive barrier. Now the restrictive barrier is what you're going to name somatic dysfunctions on. So restrictive is the abnormal barrier. So back to our head rotation example, you can rotate to the left, but you cannot rotate to the right. You always name it by what it can do, so don't get tripped up. So, you can rotate to left, so this is a left rotation dysfunction. Remember always name by what you can do. In the example that we drew with the vertebra, you can rotate the segment to the right all the way to the anatomic barrier, but when you begin to rotate to the left, you're going to reach the restricted barrier very quickly. You can't rotate left, but you can rotate right. So, it's a right rotation this function. The final piece of vocabulary that you need to know are muscle contraction types. The first muscle contraction type is isotonic and there are two versions. The first is concentric. So, what is a concentric contraction? A concentric contraction is when you activate your muscle and it's going to bring the origin and insertion or the two ends of the muscle closer together. So, to imagine this in realistic terms when you're in the gym, you're lifting weights for your bicep curls, you're activating your biceps and you're bringing the two ends of the muscle closer together during your positive motion. This is going to be a concentric contraction. So, it's a contraction that leads to approximation of the ends of the muscle. Now the other type of isotonic contraction is Eccentric. This is where when you're contracting the muscle, an elongation is going to occur bringing the two ends of the muscle further apart from one another. Back to our gym example you're doing your positives, which is a concentric contraction. When you start to release a little bit of pressure, but you're still contracting and going down into your negative motion, that's going to be eccentric contraction. You're still contracting your biceps, but you're going out further. So, the two ends of the muscle get further apart. The next type of muscle contraction is going to be isolytic. Now this muscle contraction is where an outside force comes and breaks the patient's muscle contraction force thus causing a rapid elongation of the muscle and separating the two ends of the muscle. For an example, imagine that someone's arm wrestling. Both people are contracting their arms together, but eventually one of them is going to win and break the contraction of the other person. That breaking is isolytic contraction. So, breaking the force. The final type of contraction is going to be isometric. Now in osteopathy isometric is probably going to be the most important type of muscle contraction. This is a type of muscle contraction that you are going to perform on your patients when you're treating them with muscle energy. We'll discuss that in one of the next videos. Isometric contraction is when the patient is making a contraction, but there is an outside force probably from the physician that's equal and because of that both forces cancel out and there's no approximation or lengthening of the muscle, even though the muscle is still contracted. So, two different forces coming together that equal each other out. Both muscles are contracted, but the ends are not approximating or elongating. So, there's no change in the ends of the muscle during an isometric contraction. So, we went over a lot of stuff, but it's really important that you understand the vocabulary before you move on trying to understand the rest of OMM. We discussed what a dysfunction is and how you name it by what it can do. We discussed the TART changes for red-hot acute dysfunctions and cool blue dysfunctions for chronic. We talked about planes and axes of motion. We went over the different barriers that you can reach and we wrapped it up with different types of muscle contractions and that's your introduction to OMM. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to OMM]  
﻿Learning OMM is a lot like learning a completely different language. You have to learn the vocabulary first so you can understand everything that's to come later on. The way that this course is laid out is in a very particular order. So if you watch it in that order, all the topics, concepts and language that we use is introduced throughout, so that at the end it all makes sense. For you to do well in this course, not only do you need to understand the information that I give you, but you also need to be able to learn the concepts and be able to apply the concepts to different situations. When you take an exam, you're going to see information that you haven't seen before, and what the exam writer is wanting to do is to see if you know the concepts. So in this lecture we're going to go over some of the basic vocabulary that you're going to use for the rest of the course. So to start off with, what is a dysfunction? A dysfunction is basically an abnormal function of normal anatomy. So what you can and cannot do. So an example of this would be normally I can flex my arm all the way in, I can extend my arm all the way out. If I cannot bring my arm all the way into flexion, that's what we would call a somatic dysfunction. So abnormal function of anatomy. So how do we name a dysfunction? How do we know between each practitioner what we're talking about? What you need to do is you need to name the dysfunction for what the segment can do. It sounds confusing because you want to say that the arm cannot flex, so you think that you want to say can't flex. In reality, what you say is the patient has a extension dysfunction, which means that they can extend and they cannot flex. So you always name it by what it can do. So how do I find some of these dysfunctions? What are some of the palpatory findings I'm going to see? This is what classifies as a TART change, and TART stands for texture, asymmetry, restriction and tenderness. And depending on if the dysfunction is acute or chronic, you're going to have different findings for each section. If you have an acute dysfunction and you're palpating the tissues, you're going to feel hot tissues or boggy or even moist. So think about it as being brand new. It's still red hot. So the dysfunctional palpatory findings will be hot, boggy, moist when you palpate the skin. When you do your palpation, you're also going to feel asymmetry, so one side is not going to feel the same way that the other side will feel. It'll feel asymmetric. For restriction, we're really talking about pain on motion. So since it's brand new, it's an acute dysfunction, you can imagine that there's going to be a lot of pain on movement. So let's say if the patient just hurt their back and they just got a spine somatic dysfunction, when they bend forward or try and rotate, it may be very painful. And this is telling you that it's an acute dysfunction. For tenderness, they're doing the quality of the pain. So if it's acute, the pain will be intense or sharp. So if I take my thumb and I jam it, whatever muscle is dysfunctional is going to feel intense, it's going to feel sharp. So if on an exam you have any of these findings, the exam writer is trying to tell you that it's an acute dysfunction. And then we're going to compare that to chronic. Chronic or ongoing dysfunction is going to have palpatory findings that are basically the opposite of acute. So you're going to feel cool tissues or they're going to be ropey tissues or they'll be dry tissues. When you're feeling for symmetry, you're still going to palpate asymmetry, so that's going to be the same for acute and for chronic. If it's a chronic dysfunction, it's been lingering a little while. The rest of your body is starting to compensate, so it may have decreased pain on motion or even no pain on motion at all. And if it's been sitting around a while, it's not going to be nearly as intense or nearly as sharp as it was when it first occurred. So it's going to be more of an achy pain or a dull pain. So when you jam your thumb into it, it feels more achy or it feels more dull. So there are three primary motions that occur in every segment. You can have flexion, which is bending forward or anteriorly, you can have extension, which is bending back posteriorly. You can have rotation, which is turning your body, and you can have side bending, which is moving your body to the left and to the right like this. Each of these motions occur in a plane, in a round and axis. So to label the planes of motion, we're going to use some pictures. So a plane of motion, you can almost imagine it as if the body is being cut directly in the motion, and you're getting two equal slices on each side. So for a sagittal plane, it's a plane that cuts right along the bridge of the nose and goes directly down the rest of the body. So you're going to be split right down the middle like this. For a transverse plane, it's going to go from ear to ear. It's going to go horizontally. So transverse plane would be if I get a cut right here and I can separate the top half and the lower half of my body into two completely different segments. So the last plane is the coronal plane. Now this plane, imagine if you're wearing a crown for your coronal plane, and it cuts directly down the middle. So it'll be a slice just right here and it will fold out your body like this. So next there are three axes of motion. You can have a horizontal axis, which is a singular line that goes through the body. So imagine if I take the pen, push it through my body, that's the axis. You're not cutting the entire body, it's a singular point. So horizontal axis goes from hip to hip. A vertical axis goes from the top of the body all the way down to the bottom. So if I take the same pen, through the head, out the feet, that's the vertical axis. And finally, you have an AP axis, or an anterior posterior axis. It goes directly from the anterior side to the posterior side. So if I push directly towards me. Now each of these axes can be moved slightly around the body, depending on where you want to be turning. So the AP axis can be located in the center, it can be located around the neck, on the hand, wherever. But wherever the axis is, the rest of the rotational component will occur around that axis. So now to talk about flexion, extension and side bending. So each of these motions will occur on a plane and around an axis. So the easiest way to think about this would be think about an umbrella. An umbrella has a handle and it also has a gigantic upper part that protects you from the rain. If you're twisting the handle around, the top part will spin around as well. If you imagine the handle of the umbrella is the axis and the umbrella itself is the plane, then that gives you an idea of how the planes of motion actually work around each axis. So if we're talking about flexion and extension, we need to relate that to the umbrella. The easiest way would be to stick one of your arms up and then flex and extend. And when I'm making that motion, I'm drawing the plan with my arm going around. And that plane is going to be a sagittal plane. Now with that same analogy, imagine that I'm taking an axis and going 90 degrees at the plane, which means that it will go directly through my hips. So if I take that umbrella handle and twist it, I'm flexing forward and I am extending backwards. So the plane that flexion extension occurs on is the sagittal plan, and the axis that it goes around is horizontal. Now for rotation, it's the same umbrella idea. If I stick my arms out and I rotate, I'm drawing the transverse plane with my arms. If I'm wanting to do the rotation on the umbrella stick, I'm twisting my body around it, so it's going to be the vertical axis. And for side bending, the same idea. If I stick my arm out and I side bend, I can draw the plane with my arm. That plane that I'm drawing is the coronal plane, and the 90 degree axis is going to be the AP axis. So now that you understand the axes and planes of each motion, you need to understand the barriers and you need to learn the vocabulary for barriers. So to do this, we are going to look at a single vertebral unit. So there are a few different barriers that you need to learn the names of. The first one is neutral. So in neutral, the patient is totally relaxed. They're sitting still. This is how the anatomy normally sits in neutral. So relaxed. The next barrier is going to be the physiologic barrier. Now if I'm going to take my vertebral segment and rotate around this axis and I get to the P, that's the physiologic barrier. Now physiologic is the range of motion that the patient has during active movement. So if I am actively trying to rotate my head to the right and that's as far as I can go, that's the physiologic barrier. So active motion. The next barrier that you're going to hit is the anatomic barrier. Now, if the practitioner comes in and they decide that they're going to rotate my head, they can probably move my head more in the rotation than I would be on my own. So that passive motion is going to reach a further barrier. That's the anatomic barrier. Now the final barrier that you need to understand is the restrictive barrier. So the restrictive barrier is some sort of abnormal barrier, a barrier where you shouldn't be stuck at. So if I'm rotating this vertebral segment all the way down to the left, so if I'm rotating to the left, I should be able to passively move the segment all the way to the anatomic barrier. But if I get stuck here and I can only rotate a little bit, that's the restrictive barrier. Now once again, they're not able to rotate all the way to the restrictive barrier. This is confusing because of how you want to name the diagnosis. Remember, you always want to name it based off what it can do. So it seems backwards, because you want to say it's stuck rotated in this direction. In reality, you want to say what it can do. So it can rotate the other direction normally, and that's what you would name it on. So the last thing that you need to understand is the types of muscle contractions. And there are two types of isotonic muscle contractions. You have concentric and eccentric. Now concentric muscle contraction is when the patient actively contracts their muscle, it brings the origin and the insertion closer together. So if I am concentrically contracting my bicep, I'm bringing my arm further this direction. So one way to think about it would be you're at the gym, you're doing your positives for your gains, you're bringing your arm up, that's a concentric motion. An eccentric contraction is a lengthening of the muscle while the patient is still contracting the muscle. Easy way to think about eccentric contraction is if you're still in the gym, you're doing your negatives, so you've already flexed up. You have the weight, you're still contracting the muscle, but you're slowly elongating the muscle. This elongation is eccentric. Next type of muscle contraction is isolytic. Isolytic is where an outside force breaks the patient's muscle contraction 100 percent. So the easiest way to think about this would be if you are arm wrestling someone who is bigger than you. When you're arm wrestling, you're holding it steady, but eventually their strength overtakes you and you let it go. That is isolytic. It's breaking your muscle contraction. And the final muscle contraction type is isometric. Isometric is the most important muscle contraction for osteopathy. This is the type of muscle contraction that we're going for during most of our treatments. So isometric means that the amount of contraction that the patient is exhibiting is the same amount of contraction that the practitioner is exhibiting, so both forces cancel each other out. So even though I'm pushing, I'm not elongating and I'm not shortening the muscle group. So that's isometric. So this is the vocabulary that you're going to need to continue with the rest of the course. We started off with what is a dysfunction? How do you name the dysfunction? TART changes for acute and chronic dysfunctions. Planes of motion, axes of motion with our umbrella. Then specific barriers, including neutral, physiologic, anatomic and restrictive, and different types of muscle contractions. And that's the introduction for OMM. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Lumbar Spine and Psoas]  
﻿This lecture is about the lumbar area. It's more of a miscellaneous lecture just to pick up bits and pieces that didn't really fit into other discussions. So we're going to break this lecture into three big groups. We're going to talk about diagnosis of the lumbar vertebra, we're going to talk about large muscle groups and how to treat with myofascial, and then we're going to close out with the very important muscle, psoas. So we're going to start out with how to diagnose the lumbar spine. So the way that you're going to do this is the exact same way that you diagnose the thoracic spine. So you're going to assess for rotation in neutral, you're going to assess for rotation in flexion, extension, use Fryette's laws, it's exactly the same as thoracic spine. So that's the first block of this lecture. Lumbar spine is the exact same as thoracic spine. So now we're going to move over to muscle groups and how to treat with myofascial. You can use myofascial technique to treat many different muscles, but the easiest way to go over an example is going to be the large muscles of the spine. So to do that, we're going to first draw a picture. This will give you an idea of what we're talking about. So the large muscles groups that we're going to go over are the erector spinae, and this includes spinalis, which runs closest to the spine. This includes the longissimus, which is the next muscle lateral, and this includes the iliocostalis, which is the most lateral. Then you have multifidus, which runs close to the spine but is the deepest of the muscles that we're going to discuss, and then you have quadratus lumborum. So the reason that we're going to name these muscles is so that we can go over how to use myofascial technique to treat it. So let's say that we have a dysfunction in one of these muscles. When one of these muscles is dysfunctional, it's going to become hypertonic. So if you think about what these muscles originally do, they're located on the posterior side of the body near the spine. They're going to assist in extension of just standing up straight. So we're going to use these muscles to talk about how to use the myofascial technique. And this is a good time to remind you that OMM is a lot about learning the concepts of treatment. So myofascial is not necessarily the best way to treat these muscle groups, it's just one way that you can treat them. If you want to think up a way to use muscle energy, that's acceptable. If you want to use counterstrain, if you want to, then that's acceptable. But this is an easy group to talk about how to use myofascial. So the idea behind myofascial is that you're going to balance the tissue in three planes of motion. You're going to use traction, rotation and compression. So you're going to palpate the back of where the muscle groups are and you're going to add linear traction, either along the muscle or parallel to the muscle. You're going to include rotation of the muscle, which is just like a clock face, clockwise or counterclockwise, and then you can add compression to the muscle to really engage the tissue. If it's a superficial muscle, you don't have to use as much compression. If you're talking about a deep muscle like multifidus, you may need to add more compression to engage the tissues. So which direction do I move the tissues? So as we discussed in one of the previous sections, myofascial technique can be direct or indirect. Remember that direct means engaging the barrier and indirect means engaging the freedom, or doing what the muscle can do. So for our example, these muscle groups induce spinal extension. So if these muscle groups are hypertonic and the origin and insertion come closer together, that's going to be into extension. So the freedom of motion for these dysfunctional muscles will be extension. The barrier will be what they cannot do, which is elongating the muscle into flexion. So if we're going to engage the direct barrier, for this example that means that we're going to push into flexion or we are going to elongate the muscles. The way that we're going to do this is add traction, rotation and compression to the muscle in order to elongate it, or until we feel a hard end feel during treatment. Now we're going to do the opposite of that for indirect. We're going to engage the freedom, meaning that during our traction, rotation and compression, we are going to move the muscle into the position of ease or the position where it wants to go to the freedom. So as we're doing this, we're going to know we're in the right spot when the tissues feel loose under our hands after we've applied the three planes of motion. Also, as we discussed in one of the previous lectures, myofascial technique can either be active or passive. And the way that this is going to come into play is by using enhancers. Enhancers is another way that you can change the technique in order to best fit your patient. So if we're going to use enhancers for this treatment, I'm going to set the patient up into the three planes and either engage the direct or indirect barrier, and then I'm going to ask the patient to flex the muscle groups. So I'm going to ask him to extend his spine to engage these muscles. That's going to be your enhancer, and that makes it an active technique. If you are going to use enhancers for different muscle groups, you're just going to have them engage whatever muscle you're treating. So if you're doing myofascial to the diaphragm, you're going to ask the patient to inhale and exhale to engage the diaphragm. So once you have the patient in the correct barrier and you are using enhancers or not, you hold until you feel a release. Now the release can be one of many things. It can either be a warmth feeling, it can be a rush of fluid, it can be the tissues melting under your hands or becoming loose. You just hold it until you feel that feeling. Once you're there, you can release the three planes of motion, return to neutral, and always rescreen. For any treatment that you do, regardless of if it's myofascial, muscle energy, counterstrain, whatever, when you're done with the treatment you have to rescreen to assess for efficacy. So now we're going to leave myofascial behind, and this is part three of the lecture. This muscle is a board's favorite. It always shows up. It's the psoas muscle. An important concept to understand is where the muscle originates and where it inserts. This can give you a lot of information on what the muscle does and how you can best treat it. So the origin of the muscle is T12 to L5. And the insertion is the lesser trochanter of the femur. So if I'm going to draw a picture of where this muscle is, where this is the sacrum and this is the spine, it's going to attach to the lesser trochanter right here. So what's the action of this muscle? Well, if you think about it conceptually, when a muscle contracts it just brings the origin and insertion of the muscle closer together. So if you know that the origin is on the spine and the insertion is on the lesser trochanter of the femur and you contract the muscle, you're going to induce hip flexion, and it can also induce very slight external rotation of the leg. So what do you have if the muscle is dysfunctional? How do you tell in a patient? What are some of the findings that you'll see? So if it's dysfunctional, the patient may present with lower back pain. If you imagine that the muscle is hypertonic and they're constantly contracted, they may have some lower back pain. Easy one. The next one that you will see is a pelvic shift. So to demonstrate this, I'll do another picture. So here's your sacrum, here's your spine, here's your femur. And the psoas muscle is now hyper-contracted. This hypercontraction leads to the pelvic shift. So if this is contracted on the right side, you can imagine that the patient's pelvis is going to be shifted to the left. So if I'm going to demonstrate this, if my right psoas is contracted, making me lean this direction, my pelvis is now shifted to the left. Another finding that you may see is gait dysfunction. So as you can imagine, if someone has a pretty severe pelvic shift and they're stuck in this position, when they're walking they're going to have to compensate for that shift. So they're going to have some sort of gait abnormalities. Another thing that you may find is an increased lumbar lordosis. As the psoas contracts, it's going to change around your lumbosacral angle. And this lumbosacral angle can also be called a Ferguson angle. This angle basically explains how tipped forward your sacrum is in relation to your pelvic anatomy. So the more that you dip into flexion, the more intense your lumbosacral angle will be, which will then include an increased lumbar lordosis. Another finding that you'll see a positive Thomas test. The Tomas test is when you have a patient laying on the table supine, and they have both of their legs dangling off of the edge of the table. You ask the patient to raise one of their legs up and bring their knee close to their chest. If the other side psoas muscle is dysfunctional or contracted, the other leg will passively come off the table as well. It's going to be pulled off the table by this hypertonic psoas muscle. And one final finding that you're going to have is spinal dysfunction. So as you can imagine, since the origin of the psoas is on part of the spine, if it contracts it's going to induce flexion, rotation and side bending ipsilaterally, so to the same side of dysfunction. So what can cause one of these dysfunctions? There are a few different ways that it can happen. One way is by bending forward. So let's say that you have a patient come in. He's having gait dysfunction and a positive Thomas test. He also explains that he's a carpenter and he is constantly bent over his work table for long periods of time. That excess bending forward can induce a psoas dysfunction. Another cause of dysfunction can be if you activate the muscle too quickly, as in getting out of a chair. Imagine you're calling your grandpa sitting at home. He's sitting in his chair, he hears the phone ring, and he jumps up because he's so excited. That quick jumping motion can cause a psoas dysfunction. So not only can you get a dysfunction through movement, but you can also get a dysfunction throughout other body organs. So one test favorite is ureteral calculi. If you think about anatomically where the ureters lie, they run over the psoas muscle. So if there is a calculus found inside of the ureter and it starts to become inflamed and bother the tissues around it, it can cause a psoas dysfunction. Same concept behind diverticulosis. So we have the patient, have how to identify it and we have what causes it. So how do we treat it? So once again, you have to bring up concepts from the past. So you can treat this using multiple different strategies that we have learned in the past. You can use muscle energy. You just have to remember how muscle energy works. So you stretch the muscle, engage the barrier, ask the patient to isometrically contract. If you want to, you can try and use myofascial. It may be difficult to use myofascial because you're not going to be able to compress the psoas muscle as well without squishing their organs. Or you can do everyone's favorite, counterstrain. Remember, counterstrain is an indirect technique. That's why we're going to write it in blue. So if you want to find the tender point, you have to know where the ASIS is and where the umbilicus is. Once that you know where these two landmarks are, you then have to travel two-thirds of the distance between them and palpate deep. That's where the tender point will be for the psoas muscle. Now if you want to treat it using counterstrain, what do you have to remember? Fold and hold. So the easiest way to think about fold and hold is put the muscle where it can go. Do what the muscle does when it contracts. So what does the muscle do when it contracts? Goes into flexion and it externally rotates. So if you're going to treat using counterstrain, flex the spine, side bend the side towards the muscle, and if you need to adjust a tiny bit, you can induce a little bit of external rotation of the leg. So once again, applying this to what we know about what the muscle does, the muscle flexes the spine, side bends the spine toward the side of dysfunction, and slightly externally rotates the leg. So that's the exact position that we're going to put it in because this is an indirect technique. So this lecture was a grab bag. We went over three big topics. We went over how you diagnose the lumbar vertebral segments. It's exactly the same as the thoracic vertebral segments. We went over the large muscle groups of the back in order to give an example of how to use myofascial technique. And we also went over the really important muscle of the psoas, including origin, insertion, dysfunction, and everybody's favorite, counterstrain. And that's OMM of the lumbar area. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Lymphatics]  
﻿When learning about the lymphatics, it's often easy to get weighed down with all the detail of where the system goes, what body part drains into what. But we're going to keep this very osteopathically focused and show you exactly what you need to know in order to get the question correct. There's a simple flow that you have to follow for every single patient every single time. So if you have a lymphatic question, go through this flow every single time and you'll get the question correct every single time. So to start off with, how does the lymph normally move throughout the lymphatic system? There are two big forces that help push the lymph throughout the lymphatic system. You can have smooth muscle contraction and compression. So imagine that you have fluid stasis in your lower extremities. When you're walking around, you're compressing the vessels in your lower extremities, and that's forcing the fluid to go back up throughout the rest of the system. When you're thinking about smooth muscle, imagine something as being squeezed at one end and it's forcing everything else in the same direction. That's the idea of what normal motion is. So what are you going to see in a patient who has some sort of abnormal motion? Oftentimes you're going to see some sort of fluid stasis. If you see a patient who has some sort of fluid stasis, you may want to consider treating the lymphatic system. Another patient that you might want to treat is one who has a mild infection. We're going to loop back around to mild infection at the end of the lecture. So what about some contraindications for treating the lymphatics? The main contraindications that you need to think about are fractures, cancer, mainly metastatic cancer, and severe infection. The general idea is that if a patient has one of these three things, you don't want to make the condition any worse by spreading it around by doing some sort of lymphatic technique. So what's the formula that I need to know in order to get these questions correct? So let's imagine that the waves of water represent some sort of fluid stasis somewhere in the body. The idea is that it gets stuck because of a choke point. The choke point is simply some sort of clog or choke in the lymphatic system. The choke makes it so that the rest of the lymphatic fluid cannot flow through that area, thus creating the choke point. There are numerous choke points throughout the body, and there are really five major ones that we're going to talk about. So why do these choke point even matter? The whole formula is that you have to treat the choke points in a certain order. You always follow the order, no matter what. You always start in one place, you end up in the last place. Never skip around in the order. So what are these choke points? The first one that you always want to treat first is the thoracic outlet. So theoretically, there can be many different things that cause a thoracic outlet choke point. Anything in the area can really do it. But two common ones that you can see are clavicle dysfunctions in ribs 1 and 2. If you have some sort of dysfunction in one of these two structures, then you may have a thoracic outlet choke. So how do you treat it? We've already talked about how you can treat these in previous lectures. So clavicle, you can treat the AC or the SC joint. In ribs 1 and 2, you can treat using an inhalation or exhalation treatment. The next choke point is going to be the diaphragm or the axilla. So what structure will cause a choke point at the diaphragm? The diaphragm. So when you're treating the diaphragm, how are you going to do it? You can dome the diaphragm, you can treat the attachment points at ribs 6 through 12, attachments points are L1 through L3, and xiphoid. We already talked about how you can treat ribs 6 through 12 and how you can treat L1 through L3, but we haven't talked about doming the diaphragm or the xiphoid. Just apply some of the concepts that you learned earlier in the lecture series. If you do a direct myofascial technique to the diaphragm, you can insert your fingers under the rib cage and push it where it does not want to go into the restrictive barrier. And the opposite for an indirect technique, push it into the freedom. So this is how you would treat the diaphragm, but what about the axilla? Just like for the thoracic outlet, anything that's up in the axillary region can cause a choke point in the area. But one common cause is pec minor. So if you want to assess the axilla for a choke point, assess pec minor. And if you want to treat it, apply some techniques that you learned earlier. You can either use muscle energy, you can use myofascial, whatever you feel like doing. The next choke point is going to be the hip. And what are some common dysfunctions that cause a hip choke point? You can have the psoas, the quads, and the innominates. We talked about how to treat these three structures in earlier lectures. If you are assessing for some sort of a hip choke point, check these three structures, and if they're dysfunctional, treat it and you'll treat the choke point. The next one down the list is going to be the posterior knee. So what can cause a choke point here? Think about some structures that attach to the posterior knee, like the hamstrings and the gastroc. If you want to treat the posterior knee, you can do it any way that you want to. You can do a direct myofascial technique and release the structures into the barrier, or you can push them into the freedom for an indirect technique. Muscle energy, engage the barrier, so on and so forth. Now what about the final choke point? The final choke point is going to be whatever the distal dysfunction is. And how are you going to treat it? You treat whatever the dysfunction is. So no matter what the dysfunction is, if you're treating the lymphatic system, you always have to follow the flow. You always start at the thoracic outlet. Then you move to the diaphragm or axilla, then you move to the hip, then you move to the posterior knee, and then you do the distal dysfunction. The only time that this changes is when you are assessing the thoracic outlet and they do not have a dysfunction in that area, you can skip it. You can't treat something that's not there. But if you skip it, you have to go to the next choke point down the list. So you have to go to the diaphragm or the axilla. Then you have to go to the hip. So what about diaphragm or axilla? If it's an upper extremity lymphatic issue and you're trying to treat the upper extremity, there's no real reason that you need to be treating the hip and the posterior knee. So you can treat the thoracic outlet, then go to the axilla, and then perform pump technique. So once that you've released all of the choke points in the very specific order that you have to go through every single time, you can then finish the treatment using a pump. There are a few different pumps that you can use in different situations. You have the pedal pump, which is also known as the Dalrymple pump. You can use the thoracic pump, which is also known as the Miller pump, or you can use extremity milking. So why would I use a different pump depending on which portion of the body I'm in? If you follow the example and the distal dysfunction is somewhere in the lower extremity, you'll want to do a pedal pump. Lower extremity, use the feet. And remember, this is a treatment where the patient is lying on their back, they have their feet out, and the doctor will push the feet forward quickly to get the fluid moving. If the lymphatic treatment that you're wanting to do is in the thoracic region, then you do the thoracic pump. If it's in the upper extremity, you can do extremity milking, where you just squeeze the upper arm to push the fluid in the direction. So now we're going to loop back to mild infections. If you have a patient who comes in with some sort of a common cold and you need to help move around some of the fluid in the sinuses, you can just do a facial sinus pump or effleurage. One treatment for otitis media would be the Galbreath maneuver. And remember, this is the technique where the physician grabs the angle of the mandible and pulls forward to help open up the Eustachian tube and get fluid moving. So in this lecture, we went over the order that you have to treat the lymphatic system in. No matter what the dysfunction is, you have to start at the thoracic outlet. If there is no dysfunction at the thoracic outlet, you can then move on to the next choke point down the list, which will be the diaphragm. No dysfunction, move down the list to the hip. No matter where it is, go through the list in the exact order. And then finish off your technique with one of the pumps. And that's OMM for lymphatics. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Posterior Chapman Points]  
﻿Here we go again with the Chapman's points. In the previous video we went over how to draw the anterior locations, but now we need to complete the set and talk about the posterior locations. This is going to be different than the anterior side, where the Chapman's points were located in the inter-rib spaces, on the posterior side they're located on the transverse processes. So, to start off we're going to draw our spine and our transverse processes and we're going to draw are spine down the middle. So, we're going to label all the lines that we went through C1, C2, T1, T2, all the way to T12. Then you move down to the lumbar spine. L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5. So, the first posterior Chapman's point is going to be on the transverse process of C1 and this point is going to represent your ear. The next point is on the transverse process of C2 and we're going to call this the ENT grab bag. It's going to include the nose, the sinus, the tonsils, the larynx and the pharynx. Next you move down to T2 transverse process on the posterior side and this is going to be your posterior Chapman's point for the heart. You can move down and draw two more red dots, which will represent your upper lung and your lower lung. Next, draw more red dots on T5, T6 and T7. Now remember you're looking at the body from the posterior side. So, the side that the stomach is going to be on is going to be on the left. So, this first point will be for your stomach acid. The second point is stomach motility and your third point is your spleen. So just keep it straight anatomically when you're looking on the posterior side these structures are on the left. If you move over to the right, these first two points are for your liver. You have a second point on the transverse process of T6 for your gallbladder and below that you have your pancreas. Next you can draw three more dots going down T8, T9 and T10. These are going to represent your posterior Chapman's point for your small intestines. So, we'll put a big S in a big I small intestine. So what about the large intestine? Large intestine is pretty unique. It covers the full area instead of just a point. It's going to be on the lateral sides of L2, L3 and L4 in a triangular shape. So, we'll draw a big L and then a big I for a large intestine and this will be bilaterally. So, L2, L3 and L4 large triangular shape going lateral. Next you need to draw the posterior Chapman point for the adrenal gland. We're going to make a triangle, because it looks like the cap of the kidney, then you can do the rest of the renal system by putting a dot on L1, L2 and L3. These are going to represent your kidney, your bladder and your urethra on both sides. So, your kidney, your bladder and your urethra. Next you have the weird GU Chapman's points on the posterior side. So, for this you're going to palpate out to the PSIS and here you're going to palpate the prostate, the vagina and the broad ligament. To finish it out, you need to put a posterior Chapman's point on the transverse processes of L5 for the uterus. Now location for the ovary is kind of tricky if you don't remember it. The way I remember it is the uterus is on L5, 5 x 2 is 10. So, the posterior Chapman's point for the ovary will be on T10. And finally, the last Chapman's Point. Don't forget it. It's for the appendix. It's going to be on the lateral side of T11. So here it is hanging off of T11. Don't forget the appendix. So, go home practice drawing this out a couple times, so that when it comes test day you can draw this out pretty quickly and get all the answers correct on where the posterior Chapman's points are located and that's OMM posterior Chapman's points. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Ribs]  
﻿When I was in school, one of my teachers told us that ribs are half the COMLEX. And while I may not agree with it being half of the questions on the COMLEX, there are definitely a large number of questions devoted specifically to ribs. So if you know how to get the correct diagnosis, then you can get the questions correct and it's some easy points. So to go over it, we're going to do some basic anatomy, some of the movements of the different ribs, the dysfunctions and how to treat them. So to start off with, we're going to go over the basic anatomy of the ribs. There are five landmarks on each rib that you're going to need to know. This is going to be the head, the neck, the tubercle, the angle and the shaft. And these landmarks are going to tell you if the rib is a typical rib or an atypical rib. So a typical rib has all five landmarks. It has a head, neck, tubercle, angle and a shaft. Ribs 3 through 10 are your typical ribs. So if you have typical ribs, you're going to have atypical ribs. An atypical rib either is missing a landmark or has an extra landmark. Rib 1 is atypical because it does not have an angle. Rib 2 is atypical because it has two tubercles. So rib 2, two tubercles. Ribs 11 and 12 are atypical because they do not have a tubercle or a neck. So you need to be able to classify ribs between typical and atypical. So there are three other classifications of ribs that you need to know. You need to know the difference between a true rib, a false rib and a floating rib. So a true rib as a rib that directly connects to the sternum. So we all know that all twelve ribs begin in the spine and the run all the way anteriorly to the sternum. The true ribs attach directly to the sternum. If we're going to draw this out, it'll look like this, where they attach to the sternum. The true ribs are ribs 1 through 7. Then you have the false ribs. They indirectly attach to the sternum. Their costal cartilage attaches to rib 7, which then attaches to the sternum. And this is ribs 8 through 10. And then you have what's called a floating rib. Floating rib does not connect to the sternum at all. So they're sitting all the way back at the spine without touching the sternum. The next thing that you need to learn is the motion of the ribs. Depending on which rib we're talking about, you're going to have a different type of motion. And there's three types of motion. You have pump handle, bucket handle and caliper. So we'll start off with pump handle. This is going to be ribs 1 through 5. So imagine an old-timey water pump, right? You have to pump the handle to get the water out. So relating that to the ribs, imagine that my elbow is the rib head back and the spine and my hand is the anterior portion of the rib. When I breathe in, the anterior portion will move upward, and when I breathe out, the anterior portion will move downward. So it's making this pump-like motion. So if I'm going to draw this as a picture, it will look something like this, where this is the rib, this is the sternum. During inhalation it moves up, and during exhalation it moves down. The next motion that we have is bucket handle, and this is ribs 6 through 10. So imagine that you have a water bucket. On the top it has that wire piece that goes back and forth. So relating that to the ribs, imagine that you're looking at ribs 6 through 10 and my arms are the ribs. When I breathe in, my ribs are going to go up into inhalation like this. And when I breathe out, they're going to swing back down into exhalation. So they move like a bucket handle, just like that. So if I'm going to draw this out, it'll look something like this, where this is the sternum, this is the rib, it moves up and it goes down. The final motion is caliper, and this'll be for ribs 11 through 12. So these ribs move a little bit differently. They don't attach to the sternum, so their motion is a little weird. So imagine that the ribs are attached to the back of the spine. When you breathe in, the ribs move outward, and when you breathe out, the ribs come back inward. This motion is called a caliper motion. So drawing this out, this is going to be the spine. Here's your caliper ribs, and now they move outward. So that's your caliper motion. So next we're going to talk about the muscles that you use during respiration. You can have primary muscles and secondary muscles. Your primary muscles of respiration are what you use when you're breathing when you're relaxed, and your secondary muscles are the muscles that you use when you need to get a little bit extra air in and out. So your primary muscles include your diaphragm and your intercostals. Important thing to note here is where the diaphragm attaches to the body. So the diaphragm attaches to ribs 6 through 12, L1 through L3, and the xiphoid. This is an important point for you to keep in mind. So if you're treating the diaphragm, you can do a direct technique where you're actively pushing underneath the ribcage to palpate the diaphragm, or you can treat one of these areas and technically you'll still be treating the diaphragm. You have your secondary muscles of respiration. You have your scalenes, you have pec minor, you have serratus anterior and you have your lats. So remember, you use your secondary muscles if you need to get a little bit more air in and a little bit more air out. Imagine when you're playing football, you got to breathe heavier. You're going to use your secondary muscles as well as your primary muscles. So what about rib dysfunction? So just like everywhere else in the body, everywhere throughout this course, you always name the dysfunction based off of what it can do. You're going to have two different types of dysfunctions. You can either have an inhaled dysfunction or an exhaled dysfunction. Inhaled meaning that the ribs can go into inhalation and exhaled means that the ribs can go into exhalation. So we'll start with inhaled. The ribs can go upwards into inhalation, and they cannot go downwards into exhalation. If you're going to treat this type of dysfunction, you use direct pressure. So when the patient is breathing in and the ribs are up, you would need to be the person that pushes the rib back down where it should go into exhalation. So the next type of dysfunction is exhaled. And it's going to be the opposite of inhaled. They cannot go up into inhalation, but they can go down into exhalation. So with an exhaled dysfunction, the ribs like to go down and they cannot get back up. The way that you treat these are going to be a little bit different than an inhaled dysfunction. For these, you're going to use muscle energy in order to pull the ribs back up into normal motion. And what muscles are you going to use? You're going to use the secondary muscles. So for rib number 1, you're going to use the anterior and middle scalene. For rib 2, you're going to use the posterior scalene. And then this is where the color coding helps us out. So ribs 3, 4 and 5 we're going to use pec minor. For 6, 7 and 8 we're going to use serratus anterior. And then for ribs 9 and 10, we're going to use the lats. Those are the muscles that you're going to use during your treatment. So how do you find the dysfunction in the first place? What you're going to do is you're going to ask the patient to lay on their back and you're going to palpate the ribs bilaterally as the patient breathes. When they go into inhalation, all the ribs should move upward into inhalation. When the patient exhales, all the ribs should go down into exhalation. As you're palpating both sides, you need to make a mental note of which way the ribs go. When the patient inhales and all the ribs move up, that's great. When the patient exhales, you notice that on the right side the ribs stay stuck into inhalation and they don't want to go into exhalation. So there's some sort of dysfunction over there. You always name it by what it can do, and since they can go into inhalation, that means it's an inhalation dysfunction. So the final part of this is talking about group dysfunctions. So one way to think about this is to compare it to an accordion. Everybody has an accordion at home that they play, right? So when you're playing the accordion, you go in and out. If one segment of that accordion doesn't work properly, it's going to jam up some of the other folds in the machine. So imagine the same thing for ribs. All of the ribs go upward and downward together, but if one of those ribs don't work properly, the group of ribs beside it is also going to become dysfunctional. That one rib that's causing the dysfunction for the group is called the key rib. How do you identify which rib is the key rib? We're going to use the BITE pneumonic. And the BITE pneumonic stands for bottom inhaled and top exhaled. So let's say you have a group inhalation dysfunction of ribs 5 through 7. Which rib is the key rib? Well, using the BITE pneumonic, you know it's the bottom rib, so it's rib number 7. If we're going to draw this out, it'll look something like this. So imagine that these are your palpatory findings. This group is the inhaled dysfunction and the bottom key rib is causing the rest of the ribs to stay stuck in inhalation. So this is your key rib. So this means that if you treat the key rib, the rest of the ribs will fall back into place as they should go. So remember, when the patient goes into inhalation, all of the ribs move up normally. This patient is now in exhalation. The bottom ribs went down normal, but because this key rib is stuck in inhalation, the top ribs cannot go downward normally. So you have to treat the key rib. Now let's do an exhalation dysfunction. Let's say that these are our palpatory findings for a patient during inhalation. The top ribs move normally into inhalation, they all move up. But because this key rib is dysfunctional, it's keeping the rest of the ribs below it in exhalation. So this means that you need to treat the key rib in order to get the rest of the ribs to move normally below it. And how are you going to treat this key rib? Well, it's an exhalation dysfunction, you go back to our exhalation treatments, figure out which rib it is, and then you're going to use that for muscle energy. So in this lecture we went over everything that you need to know about ribs. We talked about the anatomy and how you can divide the ribs into different groups, the typical motions, including pump, bucket and caliper, the primary and secondary muscles of respiration, how you name a dysfunction, and group dysfunctions. And that's OMM for ribs. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Rotator Cuff]  
﻿We're going to continue our discussion on the upper extremity by moving next to the sits muscles, or the muscles of the rotator cuff. We're not going to talk about the special tests, which you learned in anatomy and your MSK course, but instead we're going to talk about the function of the muscles and how we can relate this back to the treatment style and keep everything osteopathic focused. So what we're going to start off with is a picture of where the muscles are. So this is going to represent our scapula, and this is going to represent the humerus. I draw these to point out two important locations where the next three muscles are going to originate and insert. So the next three muscles all originate on the medial border of the scapula. All three of the next muscles will attach to the greater tubercle of the humerus. So we're going to go ahead and fill in our picture with the muscles, and the first muscle that we're going to start with, the supraspinatus. So the name of this muscle gives away where it's located. Supra, above, spinatus, spine of the scapula. So if we're going to draw it in, we're going to put it right here. Those are supraspinatus. The primary function of this muscle is AB duction, abduction. So what this muscle does is it abducts your arm. It pulls your arm away from the rest of your body, abduction. It's going to be innervated by the suprascapular nerve, and the nerve roots are going to be C5 and C6. The next muscle that we're going to talk about is the infraspinatus. This muscle name also tells you a little bit where it's about. Infra below, spinatus, spine. So below the spinal scapula, so we're going to put it right here. So what does this muscle do? This muscle, when it contracts, forces the arm to go into external rotation. So it will make the arm externally rotate outward. If my arm is already into AB duction, external rotation is going to look like this. So external rotation. So lucky for us, the nerve is easy to remember. It's the same nerve and it's also the same nerve roots. Super easy. The next muscle is teres minor. And the name doesn't help us with our location, but it's right below infraspinatus. Still originates at the medial border of the scapula and still attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus. The function, however, is going to be easy to remember. It does the same thing as infraspinatus, external rotation. The innervation is going to be a little bit different. It's going to be the axillary nerve, but the nerve roots are still going to be the same, C5 and C6. So we have the first three muscles down of the sits muscles. Now we have to finish with the fourth and final muscle. So to talk about this muscle, we're going to do another picture, except this time it's going to be from the anterior portion of the scapula. Previous pictures is the posterior side, this picture is the anterior side. This muscle is going to attach to a different location. It's going to be the lesser tubercle of the humerus, and it's going to originate in the subscapular fossa. This muscle is going to originate in the subscapular fossa and attach to the lesser tubercle from the anterior side. The name of this muscle is going to be subscapularis. So what does this muscle do? Well, we already have AB duction. The next two muscles did external rotation. Subscapularis does internal rotation. So if my arm is already out, internal rotation. My arm is flexed, this is internal rotation. So internal rotation. The nerve is going to be a little bit different. It's just the major and minor nerves to subscap. And the nerve roots are going to be the same except we add in an extra, C7. So to go over the muscles one more time, we have supraspinatus, AB duction, infraspinatus, external rotation, teres minor, more external rotation, and subscapularis, which is internal rotation. So sits muscles, S-I-T-S. AB duction, external rotation, external rotation, internal rotation. So now we're going to talk about dysfunctions and treatments for this muscle group. And what are we going to treat this with? Everybody's favorite, counterstrain. Now at this point in the video series, you should have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to be saying next. Counterstrain is an indirect technique. Put the muscle where it wants to go. Bring the origin and attachment closer together. Bring the origin and attachment closer together is just doing what the muscle typically does. So what position do you think that I'm going to put these muscles into to treat it with counterstrain? We already wrote them up all on the board. So this will be pretty quick. So for supraspinatus, we are going to put the muscle into AB duction, abduction, and if we put them there and we're going through the treatment position and the patient still says that the pain is not below a three out of ten like we want, we can modify it slightly. And the way that we're going to modify it is by adding external rotation and flexion. Just remember that the primary motion is going to be AB duction. The next one is infraspinatus. What does this muscle typically do? External rotation. So what are we going to put it in for counterstrain? External rotation. Again, if you're doing this treatment technique, you're still not getting the pain scale low enough to where you want it, then you can adjust with slight AB duction and slight flexion. The next muscle is going to be teres minor. And since it does the exact same motion as infraspinatus, you know it's going to be the exact same treatment position, infraspinatus. So when you're palpating these findings, where is the tender point going to be located? It's going to be located right where the muscle belly is. So when you're doing your palpations, if you feel a tender point on the superior side of the spine of the scapula, it's going to be supraspinatus. Infraspinatus, in the middle of the muscle belly, same with teres minor. So I say that to talk to you about subscapularis. Where am I going to feel that tender point since it's on the anterior side of the scapula? So what happens is the patient has their arm in AB duction and you're going to stick your finger in their armpit. There's a tiny bit of subscapularis that hangs out right here. If they have a tender point, this is where you're going to palpate it. So the final muscle is subscapularis. Counterstrain position, just like all the other ones, do what it likes to do. And what does it do? Internal rotation. And if this treatment position isn't getting the results that you want, you can add a slight bit of extension. Just remember that the primary motion is internal rotation. So this lecture's not too bad. It's the sits muscles, the muscles of the rotator cuff. Super highly tested, because these muscles are injured very frequently. So you need to remember what muscles do what motion, and how you would treat it with counterstrain. And that's OMM for the sits muscles.

[OMM - Sacral Diagnostics]  
﻿The sacrum is a topic that a lot of student have difficult with understanding, whether it's because there's tons of different motions, the diagnosis is difficult to make, whatever reason it is. But what we're going to do in this lecture is try and make it as simple as possible so you can get the questions correct on the exam. The first part of the lecture, we're going to talk about the motions that the sacrum goes through around what axis, and in the second part we're going to make a giant flow chart that will give you the diagnosis of the sacrum based on your findings. So we're going to start off with motions of the sacrum. So we're going to draw out the sacrum from the posterior side. So we're on the posterior side of the patient, we're looking towards the sacrum. This is going to be the base and this is going to be the apex. I drew it like this to make the angles very clear of where the sacral sulcus is and where the inferior lateral angle is. These two landmarks are going to be important when we start making our diagnosis. The next thing that you need to understand is how the sacrum moves. So imagine that I'm on the posterior side and this is the anterior side. My hand is going to be the sacrum. If the base of the sacrum moves anteriorly, this is considered sacral flexion. If the base of the sacrum moves posteriorly, this is considered sacral extension. So flexion forward, extension backward. This motion occurs around an axis. Now remember, from a previous lecture we had talked about an axis just being a linear point that something rotates around. So for the sacrum, you have one axis, sacrum is attached to it, flexed and extended around the axis. From a posterior side, flexed, extended around the axis. There are a few different axes, five in total, and you need to know what motion occurs at what axis. So to start off with, I'm going to talk about the midline axis. This axis is where postural motion occurs. So writing it out down here, midline is where postural motion occurs. So what do I mean by postural motion? When the patient is standing and he tips forward into flexion with his spine, the sacrum has to compensate. When you flex forward with your spine, the sacrum compensates by moving into extension around the midline axis. So it's opposite. So if you go into extension with your spine, your sacrum is going to move into flexion on the midline axis. So right now, if you flex the spine, you are going to extend the sacrum. If you extend the spine, you're going to flex the sacrum. So the next two axes that we're going to talk about are the oblique axes. There are two of them. There's a right oblique and a left oblique. The right oblique is named right because it goes through the right sacral sulcus. So right oblique. And the left oblique axis goes through the left sacral sulcus, left oblique. So writing that out, weight on left leg means that you're engaging the left oblique. And weight on right equals right oblique. The next axis that we're going to talk about is the superior axis. And there are two motions that occur around the superior axis. You have respiration and cranial. So how does this work during respiration? When you take a breath in and you inhale, the sacrum is going to go into slight extension. It's going to tip posteriorly into extension around the superior axis. So it's going to move like this, posteriorly. When you exhale, the sacrum is going to move in a flexion. The base will move anteriorly around the same axis. So writing that out, superior axis is for respiration and cranial. Inhale means that the sacrum will go into extension. And when you exhale, the sacrum goes into flexion. The other movement that occurs around the axis is cranial motion. So in this lecture, I'm just going to introduce the words, so just memorize the words for now, knowing that during a later lecture that's devoted 100 percent to cranial, we'll go over what everything means. So just remember what I'm writing down on the board. So for cranial, which is also called inherent sacral motion, when the SBS goes into flexion, your sacrum is going to go into extension. And when you're in the world of cranial, sacral extension is also called counternutation. When the SBS goes into extension, the sacrum is going to tip forward into flexion. And this motion in the world of cranial is called nutation. Don't worry about what these mean just yet. We have a lecture devoted all to cranial later in the series. So now that we understand how the sacrum moves, we're now going to go over how do you diagnose the sacrum? So you need three things in order to diagnose the sacrum. You need to know the seated flexion test. You need to know which side has a deep sacral sulcus, and you need to know which side is the posterior inferior ILA. So what do these three findings mean? The seated flexion test is when you have the patient seated on the edge of a chair or edge of a table. You have your thumbs hooked underneath the patient's PSIS, and then they bend forward in the flexion. As they go into flexion and you're monitoring with your thumbs, you take note of which thumb moves first, moves fastest or moves furthest. Whichever side that happens on is what side is dysfunctional for the sacrum. So it's telling you that that side of the sacrum is mobile. And this can either happen on the left side or on the right side. So seated flexion test, it's either positive on the left or positive on the right. Next you have the sacral sulcus. So what you do here is you have the patient laying on their stomach. You palpate the sacral sulcus and you tip your thumbs inward into the sulcus. And what you're doing is feeling for which sacral sulcus is deep and which sacral sulcus is shallow. So you can either have deep or you can have a shallow finding. It's important for you to understand that for the sacral sulcus, you can either have deep or shallow. In order to correctly diagnose the sacrum using our method later, you need to know which side is deep. So if you're given a finding that says that one side is shallow, you need to understand that they're saying that the other side is deep. So if the finding says the right side is shallow, that means that the left side is deep. So always take your findings and reinterpret them back into deep. Now posterior inferior ILA, you march your thumbs down to the ILA. You loop your fingers underneath and you palpate which side is posterior and inferior. For that, you can have two different findings. You can either have a posterior inferior side or you can have an anterior superior side. Just like the sacral sulcus, you need to understand that if you're given one of those findings, you can transfer it to the opposite side. So if they're saying that the right side is anterior and superior, this means that the left side is posterior inferior. And if you want to follow our diagnostic flow, you need to make sure that you're findings are posterior and inferior. So always change back to what findings you need for the dysfunction. So there are two different types of dysfunction that you can have for the sacrum. You can either have a flexion or extension dysfunction, or you can have a torsion dysfunction. So a flexion or extension dysfunction. That just means that the sacrum can flex or can extend. This can either be bilateral or it occurs on the right and the left side, so the entire sacrum tips forward or tips backward into extension, or this can be unilateral where only the right side tips forward or only the left side extends backward. So you can have a bilateral flexion or extension, or you can have a unilateral flexion or extension. Torsions are a little bit different. Torsions can flex around a certain axis or they can extend around a certain axis. The way that we say this to one another is by saying right on right or left on left or right on left or left on right. What this means is we are saying which direction the sacrum is rotated and on what axis it's rotated. You name the rotation based on which direction the sacrum is going. The axis that you're going to use to name the dysfunction is the oblique axis. So remember that you named the oblique axis based on which sacral sulcus you're running through. So right sacral sulcus, right oblique. Left sacral sulcus, left oblique. So there are two types of torsions. You can either have a flexed torsion or a forward torsion, or you can have an extension torsion or a backwards torsion. For flexed torsions, you can have a right on right or a left on left. If we go back to my pen example, let's say that my pen is a sacrum or my hand is a sacrum. If we use my pen as an axis that's oblique through the left side, it's going to run right here. If I'm going into forward rotation, it's going to go anteriorly. So it's going to move like this. You always name the direction of rotation based off which way the sacrum is going. The easiest way to think about this is imagine a set of eyeballs on the front side of the sacrum. When I bend forward around that left axis, my eyeballs are now looking to the left, so I'm rotated to the left. If I'm going into forward torsion around the right axis and I bend forward, my sacral eyeballs are now looking to the right, so it's a right torsion. So now the extension torsions, you can either have a right on left or a left on right. Unlike a flexed torsion, where the sacrum dips forward into flexion, for an extension torsion the sacrum dips backward into extension around that oblique axis. So if you're looking at it from the lateral side, it's going to look like this. If you look at it from the anterior side, it's going to rotate like this, back into extension. You can still name the directionality of rotation based on your sacral eyeballs. If you are rotating around the axis forward, you're rotating to the right. But for an extension dysfunction, if I'm going backwards my eyeballs are now looking to the left, so it's a left rotation. So looking at it from the forward side, going backward is a left rotation. So this next part of the lecture is going to tell you how you can interpret the diagnostic findings to tell you what the diagnosis is. This is outlined so that you don't necessarily have to understand what each finding means, but you just plug it into the flow chart and get the correct diagnosis. All that you have to remember is that it's a mirror and it's same/opposite, same/opposite, flexed, extended, right. You'll see what I mean as I'm going. So seated flexion test. You're going to have two findings. You can either have it positive on the left or positive on the right. And remember, since this is a mirror, we're only going to go over the left side right now. So the next thing that you do is you assess the side of the sacral sulcus and the ILA. Now remember, when you're interpreting the sacral sulcus findings and the ILA findings, you always want to put it into deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA. So if they tell you that one side is shallow, the other side is deep. Or if they tell you one side is anterior superior, the other side is posterior inferior. The next thing that you need to understand is that this can either happen on the right side or on the left side of the sacrum. So you have the findings of the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA on the same side. The deep and posterior inferior ILA are both on the same side. So same, or they can be on the opposite side. The next step that you need to run through is comparing the sacral sulcus in the seated flexion test. So you need to identify which side the sacral sulcus is deep on, and which side the seated flexion test is positive on. They can both either be on the right or on the left. For this side of the equation, if the seated flexion test is on the left and the deep sacral sulcus is also on the left, they're on the same side. If they're both on the same side, then you know you have a left unilateral flexion. If your deep sacral sulcus and positive seated flexion test are on the opposite sides, then that tells you that you have a left unilateral extension. If we move back up the flow chart to deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA occurring on opposite sides of one another, next we look at the deep sacral sulcus and the seated flexion test. If they are both on the same side, for example, the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the deep sacral sulcus is also deep on the left, they're telling you it's on the same side. If this happens, then you have a right on right. If they occur on opposite sides, meaning that the seated flexion test is positive on the left and the deep sacral sulcus is on the right, saying that they are on opposite sides, this tells you that you have a left on right dysfunction. So once again, same/opposite, same/opposite, same/opposite, flex, extended, right. Right because for both of these findings it's on a right oblique axis. And if the first one is right on right, the next one must be left on right. Now here's where the magic happens. I took you through every single step. I told you same/opposite, same/opposite. We went through all the findings. But for the chart, the way that we have it laid out, all you need to do is flip it like it's a big mirror, down the middle. So I can draw this out really quickly by saying seated flexion test's on the right, sacral sulcus reverse ILA, it's a mirror, so I can say this is opposite, this is same. Next we look at the sacral sulcus on the seated flexion test. Of both of these, we can have them being on the same side or the opposite. Because it's a mirror, it's going to be the opposite of the other side. And with our dysfunctions, we're just going to flip it. So we're going to start out with a right on left, then a left on left, then a right unilateral extension and a right unilateral flexion. So you can go through the entire flow chart based on left or right. There's a lot to memorize for the flow chart, and if you get frazzled in an exam, it may be difficult to remember everything. So in the next video, I'm going to show you the way that I do the diagnosis. How you draw it out, and once you understand how the motions are working, not only will you get the questions right on the test but you'll also understand what you're even talking about. So in this lecture, we went over axes of motion for the sacrum, what occurs around each axis, the three findings that you must have to get the sacral diagnosis, flexion and extension and torsion dysfunctions, and then went through the very confusion flow chart, which I made easy by saying same/opposite, same/opposite, same/opposite, flexion, extension, right oblique, right oblique, everything's a mirror. And that is how you diagnose the sacrum. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sacrum Practice and L5 Mechanics]  
﻿In the previous lecture, we discussed how to diagnose the sacrum using that massive flow chart. Same/opposite, flex extended, right axis, everything's a mirror, something like that. You didn't really know what everything meant, you just knew how to take the findings that you were given and run through the flow chart to get the diagnosis. This lecture is going to teach you how to be a good physician. It's going to tell you what the sacrum is actually doing and give you the correct diagnosis, and get you points on the exam, and make it so you don't have to memorize that massive chart. So the easiest way to do this is going to be to run through some practice questions. So you're still going to need the same three findings that you needed in the previous lecture. You need to know what side the seated flexion test is positive on, you need to know which side the deep sacral sulcus is on, and you need to know which side the ILA is posterior inferior on. You also need to remember that if they give you shallow for sacral sulcus, that means that the opposite side is deep. If they give you anterior superior for the ILA, that means that the opposite site is posterior inferior. Make sure that you know how to change both of those findings around to fit the mold. So the first set of questions are going to go over flexion and extension dysfunctions. So as a quick reminder, you can have a left unilateral flexion, a right unilateral flexion, a left unilateral extension and a right unilateral extension. If we're going to use the pen and hand method to show what these motions actually look like, it's going to look like this. So here's your axis. You have your sacrum and you're looking at it from the posterior side. A left unilateral flexion means that the left side of the sacrum is moving forward into flexion. So it'll look like this. A right unilateral flexion means that the right side goes forward. A left unilateral extension means that the left side comes backward into extension, and the right unilateral extension means that the right side comes backward into extension. So left flexion, right flexion, left extension, right extension. So let's do some practice questions. Let's say that you're in the clinic and you palpate on a patient, that they have a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, a deep sacral sulcus on the left, and posterior inferior ILA on the left. So the way that we're going to approach these questions is just to draw everything out. You're going to draw it out, it's going to show you what the sacrum is doing and it's going to give you the diagnosis. So here are your findings. The first thing that you're going to do is draw a sacrum. You're looking at the sacrum from the posterior side. The seated flexion test is positive on the left. The deep sacral sulcus is on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the left. The side that's positive for the seated flexion test is going to be the side of dysfunction. That means that every finding that you have on the left side will be dysfunctional or abnormal. The findings that you have on the right side are the normal findings, so where the sacrum should be. The next step is you can tell the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, posterior inferior ILA is also on the left, so it must be a flexion or extension. So we can draw our pen axis down the midline. So then, if we take our pen, take our hand, do the motions that we have written down, the left side is mobile because that's the positive seated flexion test, and the left side sacral sulcus is deep. So if we're going to do that, I have to push the left side forward into flexion. So this is going to be a left unilateral flexion. The left side is going forward into flexion. Left unilateral flexion. So I got that diagnosis without using the chart. I just drew it. Next question. So question number three, you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the right, the sacral sulcus that's deep on the left, and a posterior inferior ILA that's also on the left. So the first step is going to be to draw out the sacrum and draw your findings. So the seated flexion test is positive on the right. The deep sacral sulcus is on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is also on the left. The deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA on the same side, which tells you it must be a flexion or extension. So you can draw your vertical axis down the middle and figure out motion. So if we're going back to our pen and hand model, it's going to look like this. The right side seated flexion test is positive, so that's the mobile side, that's the abnormal side. That's the dysfunctional side. The left sacral sulcus is deeper than the right sacral sulcus. In order to make that happen, the right side must move backwards into extension. So in order to make the left side deeper, the right side move backward into extension. So that tells you that you have a right unilateral extension. So we got the correct diagnosis, still no chart. So let's say that the seated flexion test is positive on the right, the sacral sulcus is shallow on the right, and the posterior inferior ILA is located on the left. So the first thing that we're going to do is draw out the sacrum. So we're told that the seated flexion test is positive on the right. We're given that the sacral sulcus is shallow on the right. Remember that we need to transfer this finding to tell us which one is deep to follow our pattern. So if it's shallow on the right, that means that the left side is deep. Posterior inferior ILA on the left. So the deep sacral sulcus, posterior inferior ILA on the same side. We can draw our axis. Going back to the hand model, the seated flexion test is positive on the right, that's the abnormal side and that's the side with motion. So we are going to name the dysfunction based on which side is abnormal. So if the right side is mobile but the left side is deeper than the right sacral sulcus, then the right side must move back into extension. So the right side moves into extension, so we have another right unilateral extension. So one more question. We have a sacral sulcus that is deep on the right. We have a posterior inferior ILA that's positive on the right, and we have a spring test that's positive. So what's a spring test? A spring test is going to tell you if the dysfunction is an extension dysfunction or not an extension dysfunction. If your spring test is positive, that means that you have an extension dysfunction. So spring positive means that you have an extension dysfunction. A similar test to the spring test is called the sphinx test. It's similar in that if this test is positive, it's an extension dysfunction. If either of these tests is negative, that means it is not an extension dysfunction. So going back to our question, we're given three set of findings, so we just need to draw out a sacrum and figure out what it means. So we have a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior ILA on the right, and the sacral dysfunction is some sort of extension. So what do we do with this? Well, you know that the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA are on the exact same side, so it must be a flexion or extension. So if we're going to use our pen and hand model, we need to figure out how to make a dysfunction using those findings that gives us something that's in extension. So if the right side is deep, then we must make the left side shallow in order to give us an extension dysfunction. So this motion is a left unilateral extension. You name it a left unilateral extension because the left side was mobile. So now we're going to move on to torsions. So remember for torsions, you had two different types. You had a forward and a backward torsion. So you always name a torsion based on rotation and axis. And this is what's going to delineate between a forward torsion or a flex torsion and a backward torsion or an extension torsion. So for the flex torsions, you have a right on right and a left on left. For an extension torsion or a backwards torsion, you have a left on right and a right on left. Now if we're going to use our hand model to demonstrate what motion this goes into, we can use our pen axis and our hand as a sacrum. If we want to represent a left oblique axis, we need to make sure that the axis goes through the left sacral sulcus like this. If it goes into flexion, that means that the base of the sacrum is anterior, and the rest of the sacrum moves into flexion. This motion is a forward torsion. The base of the sacrum is moving forward. For an extension dysfunction, the sacrum is tipping backwards into extension. So it's coming back towards you or posteriorly. The way that you name the direction of rotation is which way the sacrum is going. Imagine that you have eyeballs on the anterior side of the sacrum, and when it does its rotation that's the way that the sacrum is looking. So in this example with a left oblique axis, if the sacrum moves forward in the flexion, the sacrum is now looking to the left, so it's rotated to the left. This is a forward torsion. If it goes backward into extension, the eyeballs are now looking to the right, so this is now a right on left dysfunction. This is a backward torsion. So forward torsion, left on left, backward torsion, right on left. So now some practice questions with this. So let's say that you had a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, sacral sulcus that's deep on the left and an ILA that's posterior inferior on the right. So what do we do? We're going to do the same thing. We're just going to draw it out. So we're going to draw our sacrum. We're given that the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the right. They're both on the opposite sides of one another, so that tells you it's some sort of torsion dysfunction. It also tells you that the left side is dysfunctional. The left side is mobile and you're going to name everything based off of that. So in order to make the left side mobile, that means that the axis that it rotates around must be through the opposite sacral sulcus. So the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the oblique axis runs through the right sacral sulcus. So at this point you can already fill in half of your diagnosis. You know it's something on a right oblique axis. Right oblique axis, right sacral sulcus. So now you just need to figure out which way the sacrum is rotated. So if you do a hand model, you have your oblique axis to the right, your sacrum is attached to it, the left sacral sulcus is deep. In order to make that happen, you have to dip forward into flexion. And when you go this direction, the eyeballs on the front of your sacrum are now looking to the right. So you have a right rotation on a right oblique axis. Right on right. Next question. So now you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the right. Sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, and a posterior inferior ILA on the left. So how we approach this? Draw it again. So we're going to draw our sacrum. Seated flexion test is positive on the right. You have a deep sacral sulcus on the right, posterior inferior ILA on the left. They're on opposite sides so you know it's some sort of torsion dysfunction, meaning that it must be an oblique axis. You know that the seated flexion test is positive on the right. This is the mobile side, this is the abnormal side. In order for this to be mobile, the oblique axis must run through the opposite sacral sulcus. So that means that the oblique axis will run through the left sacral sulcus. So you have half your diagnosis. It's something on a left oblique axis, left because left sacral sulcus. If we're going to use our hand model to go over what this is, we have a left oblique axis, sacrum goes on it, and in order to make the right side deep, you have to move forward into flexion. When I make this motion, the eyeballs on the front of my sacrum are now looking to the left, so I have a left on left dysfunction. Rotated left, left oblique axis. More questions. So let's say that you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, the sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, and an ILA that's anterior superior on the right. So what are you going to do? You're going to draw it out again. So you're given that the sacral sulcus is deep on the right. You're given that the seated flexion test is positive on the left, and you're given an anterior superior finding for an ILA. So remember, you have to be able to flip that over and tell which side is posterior inferior. So if it's anterior superior on the right, that means it's posterior inferior on the left. They're on opposite sides so you know it's a torsion, so it must have some oblique axis. The seated flexion test is positive on the left, telling you that the left side is dysfunctional and the left side is mobile. And for that to happen, the oblique axis must run through the opposite sacral sulcus. So you already have half the diagnosis. It's something on a right oblique axis. Right because it runs through the right sacral sulcus. If you're going to use a hand model, right oblique axis, sacrum going on it. And remember that the left side is mobile, so the left side is going to be doing the moving. In order to make the finding that the right sacral sulcus is deep, you must make the left sacral sulcus shallow. And in order to do that, you must tip backward into extension. When I tip backward into extension, the eyeballs on the front of my sacrum are now looking to the left, which means that you are rotated left on a right oblique axis. So this is an example of a backwards torsion or an extension torsion. So one more torsion example. Let's say that you have a sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, a posterior inferior ILA that's on the left, and you have a positive spring test. Approach this the exact same way as all the other ones. You draw out your sacrum. You draw on your findings. Deep sacral sulcus on the right, posterior inferior ILA on the left and a positive spring test, which means that it must be some sort of extension dysfunction. So you can put up here, extension dysfunction. So if you stop right here and think about it, it must be some sort of torsion because the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA are on the opposite sides. So the two backwards torsions that we know that go into extension are either a right on left or a left on right. In order to make a backwards torsion or an extension torsion, knowing that the right sacral sulcus is deep, we must make it so that we have an oblique axis on the right and make the left sacral sulcus tip backwards into extension. For us to do that, that means that we have a left on right. So if I'm going to draw that out, it goes into extension, this side is deep, that means this must be shallow, which means that the axis goes here, tips backward into extension. Eyeballs are looking to the left, so it's rotated left on a right oblique axis. So the next portion of this is where the test makers are going to try and have you relate the sacrum to L5. It's really not complicated. You just have to remember a few rules. So rule number one is that L5 flexion and extension occurs on the opposite direction of the sacrum. So if the sacrum is flexed, L5 must be extended. If the sacrum is extended, L5 must be flexed. Next we have rotation. The L5 directionality of rotation is going to be the opposite of the sacrum. So if the sacrum is rotated to the right, L5 must be rotated to the left. If L5 is rotated to the left, sacrum must be rotated to the right. And the final rule, L5 side bending tells you which oblique axis that the sacrum is on. So if L5 is side bent to the right, that tells you that the sacrum is on a right oblique axis. Side bent to the left, you're on a left oblique axis. Three rules, all you have to follow to tell you what L5 is doing in relation to the sacrum. So let's do some questions with it. Let's say that they tell you that L5 is neutral, side bent to the right and rotated to the left. So what do you do? They give you a neutral finding, but the rules are flexion and extension and are now lost. Use the other two rules and you'll still get the correct answer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw out my sacrum just like all the other questions. It's side bent to the right, which means that this is on a right oblique axis. So you already have half of your diagnosis. It's a blank on right. They also tell you that L5 is rotated to the left. Following the rule of L5 in rotation, the sacrum goes in the opposite direction. So if L5 is rotated to the left, that means that the sacrum must be rotated to the right. So your answer is a right rotation on a right oblique axis. Super simple. So final two examples. Let's say that they tell you that you have an L5 that is flexed, side bent to the left and rotated to the left. What's your sacral diagnosis? Draw it out, just like all the other ones. I'm going to draw my sacrum, side bent to the left so it must be a left oblique axis, so blank on left. Rotated to the left, which means that the sacrum must be rotated to the right, so it's a right on left. You can go through these pretty quickly. Right rotation on a left oblique axis. Now the final question. You're going to have to interpret two different findings to get the correct answer. So let's say that they tell you that the seated flexion test is positive on the right, the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the right. What are your L5 findings? So now you got to go backwards. You have to diagnose the sacrum first, then use your sacral rules to find out what L5 is doing. So the first thing that I'm going to do is figure out what the sacral diagnosis is. I'm going to do that by drawing my sacrum. Seated flexion test is positive on the right, sacral sulcus is deep on the left, posterior inferior ILA is on the right. They're on opposite sides so it must be some sort of a torsion dysfunction. And the mobile side is on the right. The dysfunctional side is on the right, which means that the axis must be through the left sacral sulcus. So far, you know the diagnosis is a blank on left because it's a left oblique axis. To make this work, you need to have your left oblique axis, sacrum going forward, the left sacral sulcus is deep, the right side is mobile, so you must move the right side to make it shallow, which means you're tipping backwards into extension. And now your eyeballs are rotated to the right. So you know that you have a right rotation on a left oblique axis. So now you know what the diagnosis of the sacrum is, you got to relate it back to L5. So you use the exact same rules. So you know that L5 is something, side bent in some direction, and rotated in some direction. Side bending occurs on the exact same plane as your axis, so whatever the oblique axis is, is your side bending component for L5. Left oblique axis, it must be left side bending. The other rule is that L5 is rotated the opposite direction of the sacrum. We know that the sacrum is rotated to the right, which means that L5 must be rotated to the left. Now we know that flexion extension occurs in the opposite direction of the sacrum. So if you remember that a right on left torsion is a backwards torsion or an extension torsion, that means that L5 must be flexed. So the answer to this question is L5 flexed, side bent left, rotated left. So we went through a bunch of practice questions to get the answers correct for sacral diagnosis. And in none of these questions did I use that chart that I may or may not remember. So follow this, be able to draw it out, know what the diagnosis is, and you'll be in good shape for the exam and in your clinic as well. And that's my method for diagnosing the sacrum. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Scoliosis and Leg Length v2]  
﻿This lecture is going to be devoted to scoliosis, leg length discrepancies and how the body is going to compensate for these pathologies. Now don't get lost in the weeds trying to figure out how exactly to calculate the Cobb angle and what the rules of bracings are. Don't worry about that for now. We're going to keep this very osteopathic centered. So, to start off with there are two different types of scoliotic curves. You can either have a dextroscoliosis or you can have a levoscoliosis. So, what's the difference? The difference is going to be the directionality that the spine takes. So, for dextroscoliosis it'll look something like this. Dextroscoliosis curves to the right. The convex side is on the right side. One way to remember that this is a dextro curve is it kind of looks like a D when you look at it from the posterior side. So dextro is convex to the right. Levo is going to be the opposite. Levo is convex to the left. Left levo, convex to the left. So, you can have different severities of your scoliosis. You can have a mild scoliosis. You can have a moderate scoliosis, or you can have a severe scoliosis. So how are we going to tell the difference between the scoliotic curves? What's the delineation between mild, moderate and severe? It's going to be the angularity that the spine takes. So, in order to get the angle, you need to calculate the Cobb angle. We're not really going to discuss how exactly you calculate this, but just know that you take the bottom of the spine and compare it to the top of the spine in terms of curve and you're going to calculate the angle. The worst the curve, the higher the angle, the more severe the disease. So, for mild scoliosis, you'll have a Cobb angle between 5 and 15. For moderate, you'll have between 20 and 45 and for severe it'll be an angle above 50. Now if you have a severe enough scoliosis to have an angle above 50, you need to worry about respiratory issues for your patient. And if it's so severe where it's over 75, you need to start worrying about cardiac issues. So, what can you do to help treat your patient with scoliosis? It depends on the severity. For a mild scoliotic curve, you can attempt to use OMM. For moderate, you can begin by using on them, but you really need to start thinking about bracing. And for severe, you definitely need to start thinking about surgery. So there are two different classes of scoliotic curves. You can either have a functional curve, or you can have a structural curve. Now what's the difference between functional and structural? A functional curve when the patient begins to flex, extend, side bend, rotate in some direction the scoliotic curve will not be present anymore. This is called functional. So, when the patient moves it goes away, so away with movement. Structural is going to be the exact opposite. So, no matter what they do, they're always going to have that curve. So, it's just the opposite. No matter which way they move, they're going to keep the curve. So, we mentioned treating using OMM, what exactly are we going to be treating? Well, of course, you're going to look at the spine, but here's the big topic of this lecture, compensation patterns. So the body is always going to try and compensate in order to keep the patient as upright as possible. If the patient has a curve in one direction, it's going to have to compensate by maybe moving the hips, moving the neck, moving the shoulders to keep the patient straight and because of that, they can develop somatic dysfunctions throughout their entire body all because they have a scoliotic curve. So as a visual representation, so as you can see in this artist demonstration, the scoliotic curve will be curved in one direction and the rest of the body will need to compensate by maybe side bending the head, maybe side bending the shoulders as well. It can also move around the innominates in the sacrum as well as the lower extremities. So as you can see the body will compensate in different directions. So, when you're treating the patient who has scoliosis, don't only look at their spine, look at the rest of the body for potential compensation pattern. So, when you're treating, of course, you look at the spine, you can also look at the neck, shoulders, the innominates, the sacrum, the PSOAS and the lower extremity, just to name a few. This isn't a complete list, but just some of the heavy hitters. So now we're going to move our discussion over to leg length discrepancies. So, you can have two different types of leg length discrepancies, two different types of short leg. You can have acquired, and you can have congenital. So, acquired and congenital. So what's the difference? Acquired means that at birth both of your leg lengths are the exact same. So at birth you don't have a short leg. At some point during your life, you're going to develop a somatic dysfunction that causes you to have a short leg. So, you have some sort of issue that causes it. So, some sort of a problem causes the short leg. What could some of these problems be? In some of the previous lessons we already talked about some causes of short leg, but as a reminder you can have a posterior innominate rotation in up-shear of the innominates or a PSOAS dysfunction. So, if you have a patient and you screen them and they have a short leg and you have these findings on your screen that's telling you that a somatic dysfunction is causing their short leg. This is going to be different than congenital. A congenital short leg means that you were born with one leg shorter than the other. So, in congenital you're born with a short leg and because of this you're going to have some problems moving forward. So, if you're born with a short leg the body is going to have to compensate, just like it did for scoliosis. It's going to do what it can to keep the body as straight as possible that can either be attempting to elongate the leg or it could be moving your body into a certain way so that you stay as straight as possible. So, some of these findings that can be a compensatory pattern towards a congenital short leg would be an anterior innominate rotation or a down-shear with your innominates. So, if you see a patient who has a congenital short leg, which you would know from their history or from their chart. These are the findings that you would see, because the body is compensating. Other findings that you can have for a compensated congenital short leg would be an inferior sacral base on the side of the short leg and your lumbar spine may be convex on the side of the short leg. Remember the body is going to try and compensate to keep you as straight as possible. Now here's the key to this. There's a difference on your findings between acquired and congenital. If you have an acquired short leg, these are the findings that are going to cause it and what you'll see on the screen. Congenital is someone born with the short leg. These are the findings that you're going to see on the screen as compensation. So, keep these two separate. Now if they have a congenital short leg, you can treat that using heel lifts. So, when you use a heel lift, your heel if is going to be 1/8th of an inch and you are going to increase by 1/8th of an inch every two weeks. So, the reason that you don't give it all back at once is because the body compensation patterns. The body is a big tensegrity unit. If you treat the leg length discrepancy all at once, then you're going to throw off the rest of the body with all the other compensation patterns. Now you can use 1/8th heel lift for a normal young healthy patient, but if they are elderly you need to start at 1/16th heel lift and increase by 1/16th every two weeks. So, imagine as granny is not as spry as the college kid, so you can't be treating granny the same way that you treat a young person. So, the way that you're going to treat elderly is go low and even slower. Now if they have some sort of trauma, you can give it all back at once. Now what do I mean by trauma? The patient had surgery or if they're in a motor vehicle collision and all of a sudden they come out of it with a short leg, because they're missing part of their tibia or part of their femur, you're allowed to give all of that leg length back at once. That's because there has been no time for the body to compensate. It's been too short of an interval between the damage and the rest of the compensation. So you can give it all back at once to avoid compensation patterns. So, in this lecture we went over scoliotic curves and how to name them based on directionality. We went over the severity scales, how to treat it. Different compensation patterns that you can see, and we also went over leg length discrepancies. Make sure that you keep straight acquired versus congenital and your structural findings. That is the OMM for scoliosis and leg length discrepancies. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Scoliosis and Leg Length]  
﻿This lecture is going to be devoted to scoliosis and leg length discrepancies. And you can really get lost in the weeds by trying to learn how to calculate the Cobb angle and figure out the exact reasons for why one leg is longer than the other, and yada yada yada. We're going to keep this focused on what you need to know for the osteopathic side of things and how you can help your patients if they have scoliosis or some leg length discrepancy. So we're going to start off with naming scoliotic curves. There are two scoliotic curves that you can have. If it's convex to the right, this will be a dextroscoliosis. This is also the most common kind of scoliosis. If it's convex to the left, it's a levoscoliosis. Left, levo. So what does this look like? If I'm going to draw out a dextroscoliosis, your vertebra will look something like this. Maybe not as intense of a curve, but something like this. The convex side is the curvy side. We have it pointing to the right, so this is a dextroscoliosis. If it were pointing to the left, it would be levo. One way that you can tell that this is dextroscoliosis, if you can't remember convex and what direction, this kind of looks like a D from the posterior side. So what about the severity of scoliotic curves? So there are three different classifications that you need to know. You can have mild, you can have moderate, and you can have severe. So how do we calculate these different severities? How do we know? Well, it's going to be the angle of the curve. And how we're going to calculate that is by using the Cobb angle. We're not going to go over the exact mechanism how to calculate the Cobb angle, just remember that you take the angle of the top of the curve and the bottom of the curve and this is going to give you the angle of severity. So on our chart, a mild severity angle will be 5 to 15 degrees. Moderate severity will be 20 to 45, and severe will be greater than 50. If you have a curve of greater than 50, you need to start worrying about respiratory issues. And if someone has a very severe curve above 75 degrees, you need to start thinking about cardiac issues. So what are we going to do to treat these dysfunctions? It's going to change depending on the severity. So if you have a mild scoliotic curve, you can treat it with OMM. So what exactly am I treating? You can be treating the spine for flexion, extension, side bending and rotation dysfunctions. What about for moderate? Well, moderate you can use OMM, but you also need to start thinking about bracing. Not going to go into the details about bracing, just know that as you move down the scale, you need to start doing more treatments than just OMM alone. Once you get down to the severe category, this is when you start needing to think about surgery. You can also have two different types of curves. You can have a functional scoliotic curve and a structural scoliotic curve. For functional, this means that as the patient is moving their spine, as they start to rotate, side bend, and even flex and extend throughout normal motion, the curve seems to go away. So as they curve towards the lesion or towards the curve, then the curve will start to be less noticeable. This is known as a functional scoliotic curve. So away with motion. So you can also have what's called a structural scoliosis. This is basically the opposite of functional, where it doesn't go away no matter how the patient moves. So doesn't go away. So bringing this back to an osteopathic focus, what about treatment for the patient? Well, if you're going to treat with OMM, you certainly need to look at the spine. But then here's where the main concept of this lecture comes in. You need to understand something about compensation. Now the body always wants to try and stand up as straight as possible. But if the patient has a curve in one direction, the body doesn't want them to be walking around with a curve, it wants to compensate so that they can try and stay as straight as possible. This compensation pattern is going to cause numerous dysfunctions throughout the body. It's going to look something like this, where imagine the patient has a scoliotic curve, but the rest of the body is going to need to compensate in order to stand up straight. So the innominates will have to move around. The lower extremities will have to move around. Even the shoulders might have to move around. So with this artist's rendering of common compensation patterns, you can see that because the curve is in one direction, the shoulders are going to have to compensate in the other, the neck is going to have to compensate in another direction, the pelvis is going to have to compensate, and even the lower extremity will have to compensate. This is all to make the body stand up as straight as possible. The primary points that you can think about are going to be your innominates and your shoulders. The big deal that you need to understand is that they cannot compensate in the same direction. If they compensate in the same direction, the patient won't be able to stand up straight. So you see if the spine is to the right, the shoulders are going to have to compensate to the left, while the innominates are going to compensate the opposite direction from the shoulders by going to the right. So the compensatory pattern is opposite going up and down the body. So when you're performing your OMM treatments, you need to be looking at different portions of the body in order to treat the entire patient. So not only do you need to be looking at the spine, you can also look at the neck, shoulders, the psoas, innominates, the sacrum, and the lower extremity. So you need to treat the entire patient, so you need to look at all of the common compensatory areas in order to do so. So shifting gears from scoliosis, we're going to talk about leg length discrepancies. So imagine that you have a patient who comes in whose one leg may be a little bit longer than the other, or one leg's a little bit shorter than the other. Their whole body is going to have to compensate in order to keep everything upright. So the same idea is going to hold true as in scoliosis. The body still needs to compensate, but the cause is different. Instead of scoliosis, it's going to be a leg length discrepancy. So you can have two different types of leg length causes. You can have congenital, which someone is born with, or you can have acquired. So what are some examples of acquired leg length discrepancies? Think back to some of the lower extremity and pelvis lectures that we talked about, and you can think of some of the reasons that would cause some discrepancies. Some causes of a short leg can be a posterior innominate rotation. So remember, for a posterior rotation, the pelvis is rotated posteriorly and it's going to pull all of the bones of the lower extremity up, and that's going to cause a short leg. Now imagine an up shear. You have a pelvic up shear, one of the innominates are moving up, which is then going to pull all of the bones of the lower extremity up with it, thus causing a short leg. And finally, psoas. If the psoas is hypertonic and it's causing flexion, side bending and rotation towards one side, the rest of the body is going to need to compensate, and to do that it's going to pull this leg upward and you're going to have a short leg on that side. So what about some causes for long leg? As you can imagine, they're probably going to be the opposite of short leg. So you can have an anterior innominate rotation. Remember, when you rotate anteriorly, the bones of the lower extremity will be pushed downward. And you can have a down shear. When the innominate is pushed downward, it will push the rest of the bones of the lower extremity downward, thus causing a long leg. So how about treatment? The first thing that you can look at doing is OMM. If it's some sort of acquired discrepancy, you can just treat the dysfunction like we went over in previous lectures. You know how to treat innominate rotations and you know how to treat shears. You also know how to treat the psoas. So just do that and you can potentially treat the leg length discrepancy. But if that doesn't work, you want to start thinking about heel lifts. Now as we discussed earlier, if the patient has a short leg, the rest of the body is going to compensate for that. You're going to have compensatory patterns throughout the body. When you're treating with a heel lift, you can't just give everything back all at once, because the rest of the body is still compensated. So even if you fix the leg length discrepancy, they're still going to have pelvic dysfunctions, shoulder dysfunctions, neck dysfunctions, everything. So you need to start slow and work your way forward. So you start out with a one-eighth inch heel lift. You increase this by one-eighth of an inch every two weeks. This is a little bit different for elderly individuals. For elderly, you're going to start with a one-sixteenth inch heel lift. Now think about it this way. Granny is not as spry as a college kid, so the body compensatory patterns will take a little bit longer to adjust to changes. So if you give them one-eighth of an inch heel lift, the rest of the body may not catch up as quickly as someone in college. So start even lower and go even slower. So you'll start out with a one-sixteenth heel left and you'll do the same, where you increase every two weeks. Now this is different for trauma cases. So in this example, by trauma I really mean fracture. Let's say if the patient has a femoral fracture, he has to go into the operating room and have it repaired. When he comes out, he now has some sort of leg length discrepancy after the repair. If that's the case, the body has not had time to compensate and you can give them their entire discrepancy back in a shoe lift. This is okay because since the rest of the body has not had time to compensate, if you start out slow and work you way slowly up, the body will have to compensate. But if you just give them their entire discrepancy all at once, then the body will remain normal as it has been. So in this lecture we went over scoliotic curves, the different severity types, really had to focus on different compensatory patterns and common areas that you can find compensation, and then we went over leg length discrepancies and shoe lifts. And that's OMM for scoliosis and leg length. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sequenced Structural Exam]  
﻿At this point you have many bits and pieces of osteopathy floating around your brain. You know how to diagnose the sacrum, screen for Chapman's points and even figure out something with the autonomics, but what you don't know is how to put all of these pieces together for your patient on the PE and in the clinic. You simply don't have enough time to perform every assessment on every patient. Here we're going to discuss a screening tool that you can use on every patient every time that can then help you dial in on the area of dysfunction and then you can rapidly screen and treat. So, the name of this exam is called the Sequenced Structural Exam. In some schools this is called the style screen named after the creator Dr. Styles. There are two portions of this exam. You start off with screening the spine. Now when you screen the spine, you're going to do this on every patient every time. this is the tier 1 portion of this screen. Tier 1 because you do it on every patient every time. When you perform the spinal screen, it's then going to give you an idea of which areas of the body are dysfunctional. When you know which areas of the body are dysfunctional, you can then perform a focused exam on that area, which will be your Tier 2 screen. So, the second step is your focused exam, which will be your Tier 2 exam. So, you're going to perform the spinal screen on every patient every time that's going to give you an area of dysfunction, then you can perform your focus Tier 2 exam on that specific area. So, what exactly are you looking for? The Tier 1 screen is going to identify areas of restriction. The areas of restriction are then going to tell you which portions of the body are dysfunctional. You're going to perform the exam from the occiput all the way down to the SI joint. Whichever area is dysfunctional could potentially tell you the areas of the body that you need to do a focused exam on. So, what are the mechanics of how the screen works? It's type 3 mechanics. If you recall back from one of the early lessons, we discussed Fryette's three laws. The third law discussed stacking and it said that the further that you move into one plane of motion, like flexion the less you can move into side bending and even less you can move into rotation. We're going to use this idea during our spinal screen to assess for areas of dysfunction. We're going to use both hands to perform this stacking exam. One hand, we're going to call the director and the other hand we're going to call the lever. Now don't get too tripped up on the names of the hands. They just help you remember what the hand does. So, the director hand is going to induce two planes of motion, the flexion and the side bending component. The lever hand is going to induce the rotational component. So, you put both of them together to get all three planes of motion. We're going to flex forward side bend to one side and then rotate to that exact same side thus stacking all of your motions. So, your director hand is going to flex and side bend toward whatever side that you're going to be screening and the lever hand is going to rotate towards the side of side bending. So, if you're drawing this out, the director hand is going to flex and side bend to the right. The lever hand is going to push laterally on the spinous processes to induce rotation towards the same side of side bending. So how exactly are you going to perform this exam? You're going to screen the patient from the occiput to the SI joint bilaterally. So, you can start on the left or you can start on the right. We are going to perform the stacking with the patient first standing and then in a seated position. This entire Tier 1 portion of the screen shouldn't take more than 30 seconds, but it's the most important step. It gives you where the areas of dysfunction are. So after you perform the standing and seated portion, so once that you performed the exam with the patient standing and then with the patient seated, you need to assess if the areas of restriction are still in the same locations, if the patient is standing or if the patient is seated. So, is it the same? If it is the same, the next step is going to be to assess the location. There are three different locations that you can find these areas of restriction. It can either be above C7 or at C7. It can be somewhere in the thoracic spine or it can be at or below L1. If it's at or above C7, this is telling you that you have a cervical dysfunction. So just to catch up, you've done your Tier 1 screening exam. You've assessed the patient's spine. Now you know that the area of greatest restriction is in the cervical spine. This now tells you that you can perform your focused Tier 2 exam in the cervical spine. So, some of those exams that you can perform are to assess for cranial motion. Look at the OA at the AA and look at C2 through C7. Now if the location was somewhere in the T-spine, this tells you that you have a thoracic dysfunction. Now it's not as easy for a thoracic dysfunction as it is for cervical. You now need to assess the patterns that you palpated the areas of restriction. So, the next step is to assess the patterns. So, the area of great restriction patterns. There are three different patterns that you can palpate in the thoracic spine. The first pattern will be when you're palpating the spine in the thoracic area, at one vertebral segment bilaterally you feel a dysfunctional area. So, as you flex side bend and rotate the patient as you're palpating, you feel an area of restriction on both sides of the spine. This area of restriction is worse at the spine but gets better the further that you move lateral. This is going to tell you that you have a vertebral dysfunction. So, you've now performed your Tier 1 exam of the spine. You now know that the area of greatest restriction is in the T-spine, you now know that it is in a vertebral segment. Now you can perform your focused Tier 2 exam and for that we already went over in some of the previous lessons to diagnose a vertebral segment of T-spine, you just assess for flexion and extension, side bending and rotation. Another area of great restriction pattern that you can palpate is it going to be the opposite of vertebra. When you palpate the spine at one vertebral segment on both sides, you're going to notice the area of restriction gets worse the further lateral that you move. If you palpate this, this is telling you that you have a rib dysfunction and remember from the previous lessons, you already know how to diagnose and treat the ribs. So, you'll have the patient inhale and exhale and monitor for rib motion. Don't forget that if it's a group dysfunction remember the BITE mnemonic to find the key rib. Now there's a third pattern that you can palpate in a thoracic spine. When you palpate the spine, you're going to feel a unilateral band that extends multiple vertebral segments. If you palpate this finding, it's going to tell you that you have an upper extremity dysfunction. So now you can perform your Tier 2 focused exams on the upper extremity. This can include screening the scapula, the SC joint, the AC joint, the shoulder, the radial head, the wrist and the hand. Basically, use your screening tools for something in the upper extremity. Now that you've performed your Tier 1 exam, you know that your Tier 2 exam should be somewhere in the upper extremity, you don't have to waste time looking at the patient's lower extremity. Now if your area of restriction is at or below L1, this is telling you that you have a lower body dysfunction. If the area of restriction is at or below your L1, it's a lower body dysfunction or if your areas of restriction were different when the patient was standing and seated. So, when you perform the Tier 1 exam when the patient is standing wherever the area of greatest restriction is, you just make note of it. When they are seated and you perform the Tier 1 exam again, if that location is different that automatically tells you that it is some sort of lower dysfunction. So, if it's a lower dysfunction the next step is to assess if the AGR is at the SI joint or not. If the area of greatest restriction is at the SI joint, this tells you that you have some sort of SI dysfunction. Now what two structures have already gone over that articulate at the SI joint, the innominates and the sacrum and you already know how to screen for both of these dysfunctions. So, remember for the innominates you perform a standing flexion test and to screen the sacrum you perform a seated flexion test. Now if the area of greatest restriction isn't at the SI joint, but is still somewhere in the lower body, that means that you have a lumbar dysfunction. Now just like the thoracic spine, you're going to have some different area of great restriction patterns that you need to be able to interpret in the lumbar spine. So, in the lumbar spine, there are two different AGR patterns that you need to remember. In this first pattern when you're palpating the lumbar spine, you feel an area of restriction bilaterally in the same vertebral segment. If you feel this that means you have a vertebral dysfunction. Now remember from the lumbar lesson the diagnostic exam is the exact same as a thoracic spine. So, you're going to assess for flexion extension, side bending and rotation. The second AGR pattern that you can notice when screening the spine is that unilaterally you feel a band that extends multiple vertebral segments. If you palpate this, this is telling you that you have a lower extremity dysfunction. There are many dysfunctions in the lower extremity that you know how to screen already, some of them include the knee, the fibular head, a tibial rotation, an ankle dysfunction or something down in the foot. So, over this lesson we've talked about how you can perform a Tier 1 screening exam on every patient every time just by looking at the spine. This Tier 1 shouldn't take more than 30 seconds. Once that you do that, it'll give you areas of restriction that you can then note the patterns of and perform your focused Tier 2 exams to figure out which area is dysfunctional and how to best treat your patient. This will help you a lot in the PE when you're crunched for time and you still need to screen your patient, but this can also be very beneficial in the clinic as well and that's OMM: Sequenced Structural Exam. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Shoulder]  
﻿We're now going to begin our talks about the upper extremity and some of the dysfunctions you can find there. We have this divided into three separate lectures, and this will be the first one. We're going to talk about dysfunctions of the shoulder area. So we're going to include the AC joint, the SC joint, the scapula in general and adhesive capsulitis. So we're going to go ahead and start off with the AC joint. Now the AC joint is the acromioclavicular joint. So this is where the clavicle on the lateral side attaches to the acromion. So clavicle to the acromion. What does this joint do? This joint really helps move the scapula around and keep all the structures in the area stable. If the AC joint is dysfunctional, then you're going to have some sort of immobility or some sort of instability in the area. You may even notice this in the scapula region, which is what we're going to use as our diagnostic finding. So keep stable and level scapula. So how do we make our diagnosis? You're going to do what's called a spring test or a compression test. It's where you're going to place your hands over the patient's AC joint and you're going to spring downward. And you're also going to compress. You're going to do this on both sides and you're going to assess which joint is dysfunctional. You're going to tell that by which joint has a hard in feel, which joint just isn't moving properly when you're springing or when you're compressing. That tells you which side is dysfunctional. So to diagnose, do the spring or the compression test to tell dysfunction. Let's say you have that, the next thing you're going to have to do is measure the spines of the scapula. So you're going to go around to the posterior side of the patient and you're going to take both of your thumbs and measure which spine of the scapula is where. For a dysfunction, one of the spines of the scapula may be elevated and one may be depressed. You always name it based on the dysfunctional side. So in this example, let's say that you had a right dysfunctional AC joint, and you notice that the right scapula is higher than the left. That means that you have a right superior AC joint dysfunction. So the next step is to measure the scapular spine. So what do we do about treating this? It's actually pretty simple. Both treatments are exactly the same as one another, there's just a slight tweak if it's inferior or superior. What you do is you're going to perform a muscle energy technique. You're going to have the patient seated and you're going to ask them to AB duct their arm all the way out. The physician is going to go behind the patient, place his knee on the table underneath the arm, so that the patient cannot push his arm downward. During the muscle energy treatment, the patient's isometric force will be pulling his arm down towards the table. He won't be able to go down towards the table because the physician's knee is in the way. To further engage the barrier, the patient is going to raise his arm up while the physician lifts his knee up higher. The treatment difference is all about where the hand is. If it's a superior dysfunction, you have the patient supinate their hand. If it's an inferior dysfunction, you have the patient pronate their hand. So you can remember superior supinate, or if the scapula is elevated, you put the palm up. So to write that out, we have superior dysfunction, you're going to supinate the hand and the patient is going to try and pull his arm down towards the table. If it's an inferior dysfunction, you're going to have the patient pronate his hand but you're still going to have him try and pull his arm down. So this is how you perform the muscle energy technique to treat the AC joint. Superior, inferior. So next we move over to the SC joint. So the SC joint is the sternoclavicular joint. It's where the sternum and the clavicle attach. You can palpate this area by this notch right at the top of your sternum, and you have one on both sides. So the SC joint is where the sternum connects with the clavicle. Now what does this joint do? It really helps keep everything stable as you're moving your upper extremity. When you're shrugging your shoulders, the joint will move inferiorly. When you're moving your shoulders forward, the joint will accommodate by moving posteriorly. So we're going to assess this joint by its motions. So one of the primary motions is the SC joint moves downward when shrugging shoulders. So it moves downward in relation to the rest of the anatomy of the upper extremity. When I shrug, the lateral side of the shoulder is up while the SC joint is located down. So what happens when it's dysfunctional? We use some of the concepts that we talked about from the earlier lectures. Dysfunctional is just abnormal motion of anatomy. So if the normal motion is moving downward when shrugging your shoulders, the dysfunction will be it will not be able to move like this. We're going to use this to get our diagnosis. So what we do is we go behind the patient, we palpate the SC joint bilaterally, and we have the patient shrug their shoulders. We then assess which joint doesn't move properly. Once we've figured out which one doesn't move properly, that's the side of dysfunction. The next thing that we do is we measure the height of the SC joint. So we can place our fingers on both sides bilaterally and tell which SC joint is superior and which one is inferior. You always name it off of the dysfunctional side. So if the right side is dysfunctional, and when you measure it's lower down, that means that you have a right inferior SC joint. So the second step is to measure your SC joint. So how do we treat this? So we're also going to treat this with muscle energy, but it's not going to be as easy as the AC joint. There are two completely different techniques that you need to do. So for a superior SC dysfunction, you're going to use subclavius during your muscle energy technique. So how are you going to engage this muscle? What barrier are you going to put the patient into? You're going to have the patient seated and you're going to have them move their arm backward into extension. Their isometric force will be trying to punch forward. The physician will be holding the patient's wrist and making sure that they cannot punch forward. When you're engaging the barrier, you go further into extension with the arm. So arm back is the barrier, and punching forward is the isometric force that you have the patient do. So that's how you treat the superior SC joint. Now we're going to talk about inferior. If the SC joint is inferior, you're going to use the sternocleidomastoid muscle, so the SCM. The idea of using this muscle is that it's attached to the SC joint, and when you engage it, it's going to help pull the SC joint back up where it should be. So what's the treatment position for this? You're going to engage the barrier by having the patient rotate away from the side of dysfunction. So if the SC joint is inferior on the right, the patient's going to rotate to the left. His isometric force is going to be side bending towards the side of dysfunction. The physician is going to hold the patient's head still as he tries to move into side bending towards. That causes the isometric force. So the barrier is rotate away, and the force is going to be side bend toward. Now remember, after every single technique, whether it's muscle energy or myofascial or anything else, you always have to reassess for treatment efficacy. So after the treatment, reassess by palpating the SC joint when shrugging the shoulders. The next part of this lecture we're going to talk about the scapula. The scapula is the massive bone on the posterior side of your shoulder region. Scapula can move in many different directions. It can elevate, it can depress, it can go into protraction moving forward, it can come into retraction when moving backward. So really it just moves everywhere. So what are we going to see in a dysfunction? Well, the patient will have an abnormal function of anatomy. So it won't be moving properly when the patient is doing something with his upper extremity. That's how you're going to get the diagnosis, lack of movement. So how do you treat it? You can really do just about anything to treat this if you're doing a myofascial technique. You just have to remember whether you want to do a direct technique or an indirect technique. So remember, if you're doing a direct technique for myofascial, you push the scapula where it does not want to go. You're engaging the barrier of the scapula. And if you're doing an indirect technique, you want to push it towards the freedom, where you push it where it can go. So we're going to wrap this up with adhesive capsulitis. So adhesive capsulitis is just a fancy way of saying a frozen shoulder. So when you have frozen shoulder, you're going to have restriction in some sort of movement plane of your shoulder, whether it be flexion, extension, AB duction, AD duction, whatever. The way that you're going to treat this is exactly the same, no matter what the dysfunction is. This is where you're going to use the seven stages of Spencer. So if you remember from your time at school, the seven stages of Spencer is kind of difficult to remember. So there's some pneumonics that go around from school to school. One school uses something about an ice cream cone that I don't know, but the pneumonic that I use and also happens to go pretty well for online med ed, is every fine cat takes an indoor piss. Every fine cat takes an indoor piss. So what does that mean? For this treatment, it's muscle energy. You need to engage different barriers throughout your treatment. So each of these letters represents a different barrier that you're going to engage during treatment. So the first barrier is the extension. Then you move into flexion, then you do compression with circumduction. The next step is traction with circumduction. Then you move into AB duction, abduction, then AD duction with external rotation. The next step is going to be internal rotation, and the final step is going to be the pump. So kind of difficult to remember. Just pick a pneumonic and stick with it. So how is this likely going to show up on an exam question? They're not necessarily going to ask you to diagnose adhesive capsulitis because it's so easy, but the question may say, what are you going to use to treat it? Answer, seven stages of Spencer. The question could say that they're going through the seven stages of Spencer, they've already done internal rotation, what's the next step? You got to remember the steps, and the answer is pump. So just remember the pneumonic, you'll get the question right. You can probably use this to treat some patients, too. So this is the end of the first lecture of the shoulder area. We went over the AC joint, the SC joint, the scapula, and the seven stages of Spencer for adhesive capsulitis. And that's OMM of the shoulder region. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Thoracic Spine Diagnosis]  
﻿As an osteopath, one of the first things that you learn is how to diagnose a thoracic spine. Not only is this important for the clinic and for your exams, but this also lays the foundation for everything else in the rest of this course. So to start off with, we're going to go over some very basic landmark anatomy to make the diagnosis. And the first thing that you need to understand is where the three important landmarks are. You have the body, you have the transverse process and you have the spinous process. So this is what it'll look like from a lateral view, and if you're looking from the top down you're going to see something like this, where this is the body, this is the transverse process, and this is the spinous process. It's important to know where these three are, because the body tells you which direction the vertebral segment is rotated, the transverse process is what you palpate to assess for rotation, and the spinous process is what you palpate to tell which vertebral segment you are at. So the next thing that you need to understand is the rule of threes. And the rule of threes are a set of guidelines that tell you where you are in the spinal column. Each spinous process comes out at a different angle, depending on what level of the spine you are at. So for T1, 2 and 3, the spinous process comes out directly posterior or directly horizontal. So it's at the same level that the vertebral body is. It's at the same level as the transverse process. So if you're looking at it from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this. The spinous process is going to be on the same level as the transverse process. So as you move further down the spine to T4, 5, and 6, the spinous processes are going to come out at a little bit of an angle. They're going to go down half of the level. So if you're looking at this from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this, where the spinous process comes out half of a level below the vertebral body. So this is important because if I'm trying to palpate the transverse process of T5, I need to find the spinous process, march my fingers up half of a level and then palpate horizontally to find the transverse processes. So the next three, T7, 8 and 9, come out one full level below. So they're going to look like this. If you're looking at it from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this, where the spinous process goes down one full segment. So if I'm palpating the spinous process of T8 and I move my thumbs horizontally, I'm going to be palpating the transverse processes of T9. If you need to palpate the transverse process of T8, you need to find the spinous process, move up one full level, and then go horizontally. On exam questions, they may say you palpate the spinous process of T8 and then to the sides of it you palpate the transverse processes, they're telling you that this is T9. So for the last three, you take the other rule of threes and you flip it. So for T10, it follows the same rules as T7 through 9. For T11, it follows the same rules as T4 through 6, and for T12, it follows the same rules as 1 through 3. So now that you know which vertebral segment you're at, you need to be able to name a dysfunction. And there are three components that go into naming a dysfunction. You have the flexion and extension component, you have the rotation, and you also have the side bending. So for an example diagnosis, let's say that you have T6 and it is flexed, rotated right and side bent to the right. So remember, you always name the dysfunction by what it can do. So this says that T6 can flex normally, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. So for each plane of motion, you can have only certain movements. So you can have either a flexed, extended or neutral dysfunction. Rotation you can either have a right rotation or a left rotation, and for side bending you can either be side bent to the right or side bent to the left. So now once you know the motion, now you need to find out how to make the diagnosis. So the first thing that you do is assess for rotation in neutral. So how do I assess for rotation? So what you're going to do is you're going to take your thumbs and you are going to come to the posterior side and you're going to palpate the transverse process of each vertebral segment. Depending on how deep your thumbs go in will tell you what direction the spine is rotated. So if both thumbs are level, that means that that vertebral body is not rotated. If your left thumb goes in deeper, that means that you're rotated to the right. And if your right thumb goes in deeper, that means that you're rotated to the left. So drawing it out, if you have a right rotation it's going to look something like this. And now when I'm palpating the transverse processes, my right thumb doesn't go in very far but my left thumb goes in pretty deep. So this tells me that it's rotated to the right. The way that you name the rotation is which direction the vertebral body is looking. So the vertebral body is looking to the anterior side to the right. So this tells you it is a right rotation. So once you have the rotation component, the next thing that you need to do is assess for rotation during flexion. And when you do this there are two outcomes that you can have. It can either get better in flexion, meaning that when you're palpating in flexion the rotation goes away, or both of your thumbs are now even, or the rotational component doesn't get any better or gets worse. Remember, you have to name it by what it can do. So if the segment gets better in flexion, it can go into flexion, that means that it's a flex dysfunction. Now if it doesn't get better in flexion, the next thing that you're going to need to do is assess during extension. So you're going to do the same thing. You're going to ask the patient to puff their chest out, extend to the vertebral level, and you're going to assess for rotation on the transverse process. Two things can happen here. It can either get better during extension, meaning that the rotational component during extension goes away and both of your thumbs are even, or it can get worse or not change during extension. Once again, if it gets better during extension, that means that it can do extension. So that means that you have some sort of extended dysfunction. If it doesn't get better during flexion and it doesn't get better during extension, that means that you have a neutral dysfunction. In real life, you're going to have to assess for rotation and flexion extension maybe a few times to be able to really tell if it's better during flexion or better during extension. On the exam, they're just going to tell you it gets better during flexion, it gets worse during extension, so you can figure out if it's a flex or extended dysfunction. So now that you have two components of flexion and extension or neutral and rotation, the final thing that you need to do to make the diagnosis is assess for side bending. And the way that we're going to do that is by using Fryette's laws. Now Fryette's laws are a set of rules that tell you which direction the vertebral segment is side bent during flexion, extension or neutral. So type 1 says that during neutral, rotation and side bending occur in opposite directions. So one easy way to remember this is if you draw your N, you put arrows on both sides, they're going in opposite directions. So side bending in rotation occur in opposite directions. Type 2 tells you about flexion and extension. This rule says that during rotation and side bending of a flexed or extended dysfunction, they both occur in the same direction. Easy way to remember this is to put arrows on your letters. So they're all going in the same direction, meaning that if it's a flexed or extended dysfunction, rotation and side bending both occur in the same direction. Now there is a third rule, and it's about stacking. It doesn't necessarily help you with making the diagnosis, but it is important to know. What this says is that during the three planes of motion, flexion, extension, side bending, rotation, the range of motion that you go in one direction will limit the range of motion in the other three. So the more that I flex forward, the less I'm going to be able to rotate and the less I'm going to be able to side bend. So stacking. Not very useful to make the dysfunctional diagnosis, but so important to know. So now that you know the side bending component using Fryette's laws, the rotational component and the flex sticks under the neutral component, you now have your diagnosis. And the easiest way to go over this is to go through some practice questions. So let's say you're taking the exam and it says that in neutral, you palpate that the patient is rotated to the left. It gets better in flexion, meaning that your fingers become more level during flexion. It gets worse in extension, and it doesn't really tell you anything about side bending. So what's the diagnosis? So you know that it gets better in flexion, and if you go through the flow chart, you know that it must be a flex dysfunction. So let's say this is T6 flexed, they told you that it is rotated to the left, so rotated to the left, and using Fryette's second law for a flexion dysfunction, that tells you that rotation and side bending are in the same direction. So you know that it's rotated left, which means that this is also side bent to the left. So another practice question. Let's say that they tell you during neutral you're rotated to the left. The rotational segment doesn't get better during flexion and does not get better during extension. And they also don't tell you what the side bending is doing. So what's the diagnosis? So let's say we're at T6 again. They give you that it's rotated in neutral to the left. So if we start here, it doesn't get better during flexion or extension, so we know it's a neutral dysfunction. So you can write down neutral. Using Fryette's first law, neutral dysfunction, rotation and side bending are in opposite directions. They tell you that you're rotated to the left, so you can do rotated left, side bent to the right. And that'll be your diagnosis for that. Next question. Let's say that they don't tell you anything about rotation, but they do tell you about side bending and they say you're side bent to the right. They say that it gets better during extension and gets worse during flexion. So what's the diagnosis? So this question shows that really, you can flip this flow chart backwards if you need to. If you're given side bending and not rotation, you can still run through the flow chart. You can also still use Fryette's laws and work backwards. So if it's a neutral dysfunction, side bending and rotation are still opposite. So for this dysfunction, let's say it's T6 again, side bending to the right that gets better in extension. So it's an extended dysfunction. Since it's an extended dysfunction, we can follow Fryette's second law saying that rotation and side bending are in the same direction. And we know that it's side bent to the right. So we're rotated to the right and side bent to the right. So for the last practice question, let's say that they tell you during neutral you're rotated to the right. They don't tell you anything about flexion and they don't tell you anything about extension. But they tell you that side bending occurs to the left. So what do you do? So it doesn't get better in flexion or extension, so you know it must be a neutral dysfunction. You can double check yourself because rotation and side bending occur in different directions, which is a Type 1 mechanic rule. So T6 neutral, rotated to the right and side bent to the left. So during this lecture we went over how to palpate the landmarks that are important for your diagnostic findings, the rule of threes that tells you where you are in the spinal column, as well as the relation of the spinous process and transverse process, how to name a thoracic diagnosis, Fryette's laws of how to find side bending, whether it's a neutral, flex or extended dysfunction, your diagnostic flow chart, and a couple of practice questions. And that's how you diagnose the thoracic spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Thoracic Spine Facet Model]  
﻿In the previous video, we talked about how to diagnose the thoracic spine using palpatory findings of the transverse process. In this video, we're going to talk about how to diagnose the thoracic spine using the facet model. In real life, there's really no difference to use either the facet model or the transverse process model. There's no difference. In real life, it's really just up to what you feel more comfortable with, using the transverse process or using the facets. But on an exam, you're still going to be held accountable for knowing what each finding means for both models. So we're going to go through the facet model here. So the first thing that you need to understand is where the facets are. So the facets are bony articulations between each level of the vertebrae. So if you have vertebra number 1 and vertebra number 2, where they touch is where the facets are, and that's how they move on one another. If you're making the palpation, they're located between the spinous process and the transverse process. So if you're going to draw this out, it's going to look something like this, where this is the transverse process, spinous process in the middle, the facets are going to be located right here. So when you're doing your palpation, you can palpate the spinous process, move up a little and horizontal, and you're now at the facets. So the next thing that you need to know is how the facets are oriented to one another. It changes depending on what level of the spine you're at. So if you are in the cervical spine, the facets are oriented backwards, upwards and medial. This orientation tells you a little bit of how the motion at each joint will work. When you move down to the thoracic, the facets are oriented backwards, upwards and lateral. And when you move down to the lumbar spine, the facets are oriented backward and medial. So BUM, BUL and BM. Easy way to remember it, bumblebee. BUM BUL BM. Bumblebee M. On an exam they can ask you something as simple as, which way are the facets oriented in thoracic spine? The answer would be backwards, upwards, lateral. So how do I make the diagnosis using the facets? So if I'm palpating the facets in neutral, there's no extra movement. When I ask the patient to go into flexion, two things are going to happen. The facets will open and your thumbs will move cephalad. Cephalad just means toward the head, so they move upward. So if you draw this out, it's going to look something like this. The space between the facets will open and get larger, and your thumbs will move cephalad or towards the head. During extension, it's going to be backwards. When you're palpating during extension, the facets will close and your thumbs will move caudad. Caudad is a fancy way to say down or towards the feet. My teacher when I was in school, he had a really southern accent, and when he said caudad, it sounded like he was saying crawdad. So if you think of crawdad and the legs, caudad, legs, down. So if you're going to draw this out, during extension the joint space is going to get squished closed, and your thumbs will move downward. Squished closed, thumbs down, during extension. So how do you use these findings to tell you what the diagnosis is? So what you're going to do is palpate during neutral, during flexion and during extension, just like you did when you were using the transverse process. For the dysfunction, one of the facets may not open or close correctly, and that's going to tell you everything that you need to know. So if I'm going to draw this as a picture, let's say that we ask the patient to flex forward. On the right side, the facet opens normally and my thumb goes upward towards the head. But on the left side, my thumbs stay exactly the same. They stay where they were. This tells you that the left facet is dysfunctional and it's causing a left side bending in rotation. So if you pretend that my thumb and pinkie are the transverse processes, it is now going to the left. So side bend and rotated to the left. This is your findings during flexion. Now during extension, it's going to be a little backwards. So you ask the patient to extend back. On the left side, the joint space squishes closed and your thumb still goes down towards the feet like normal. But on the right side, nothing happens. Your thumb doesn't move properly. This tells you that the right side is dysfunctional. So the vertebral segments look the same during flexion and extension dysfunctions, but you have to understand that on the left side is a dysfunction for a flex and on the right side that's the dysfunctional facet for an extended. So let's do some practice questions over it. So let's say you're taking an exam and it tells you that during flexion, both thumbs move cephalad, and during extension, the right thumb goes down towards the feet but the left thumb stays immobile. So what's the dysfunction? The way that I like to do it is I draw this out. So during flexion, both thumbs move in the cephalad. So it will look something like this. Both facets open normally like they should. During extension, the right thumb moves downward towards the feet, and the left thumb stays immobile. So the right facet squishes closed like it should, but the left facet stays open. This is telling you that the left facet is dysfunctional during extension. So if you're using this to make the diagnosis, let's say that we're at T6, everything gets better during flexion. Remember, you always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So better in flexion means that it's a flex dysfunction. And if you look at our facet picture, you can tell that it is now rotated and side bent to the right because of the facet orientation. So you can put down that you are rotated right and side bent to the right. You can even use Fryette's laws to double check yourself if you need to. You know that since it's a flex dysfunction and using the second law, rotation and side bend occur in the same direction. So rotated right, side bent right. So for number two, let's say that in flexion, the right thumb moves upward like it normally should, but the left side stays immobile. And during extension, both thumbs move down normally. So what's the diagnosis? So we're going to do what we just did, we're going to draw it out. So during extension, we know that both thumbs move normally. So both facet spaces get squished closed and your thumbs move down normally. So now we're going to draw during flexion, so the right thumb moves upward as it normally should, but the left side stays closed, which is dysfunctional. Because of this dysfunctional facet, you can now see that the vertebral body is rotated and side bent to the left. It's really important to draw these out as you're going so you don't get tripped up by which facet is dysfunctional and which one isn't, and which thumb moves whatever way and which thumb goes where. If you draw it out, it makes it extremely easy so that you can get the points correct on the test. So draw it out every time. Use your hand model if you need to. This facet's dysfunctional, this one's normal, your thumb and pinkie move this way. So it's side bent and rotated to the left. So to write out the dysfunction, we're going to put T6, it gets better during extension, so it's an extended dysfunction. It's going to be rotated to the left and side bent to the left. So left thumb is immobile and your right thumb goes upward. So now the third example. So they can tell you which directions your thumb moves, but they can also tell you which facets open and close. So you need to be able to interpret that as well. So let's say that during flexion, both facets open normally. But during extension, the right facet closes but the left facet stays immobile. So we're going to stick with the theme of drawing it to make sure that we get the question correct. So during flexion, both facets open normally. When we look at extension, the right facet squishes closed but the left facet does not close normally. So the dysfunctional segment is on the left, but you're still rotated and side bent to the right. So very important just to draw this out every time. So for our diagnosis, we're going to say T6 again, everything is normally moving in flexion, so it's a flex dysfunction, and during our picture we saw that we are rotated and side bent to the right. So the FRS right. So right closes normally, the left is immobile, and both facets open during flexion. So in this lecture, we went over where exactly the facets are, how they move during flexion and extension, the orientation of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Just remember bumblebee M, and then three practice questions to go over how to make the correct diagnosis. And that's how you use the facet model to diagnosis the thoracic spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Tips for the COMATs]  
﻿At the end of each rotation, you're going to have to take a standardized exam. In the DO world these are called COMATs. The exam is going to go over everything that you were supposed to have learned over that rotation, but there's also going to be an OMM component. Of course, it's a good idea to just know everything, but each COMAT it may be a good idea to get really deep into specific osteopathic topics. So, to start off with we'll start with Pediatrics. Now in Pediatrics the cranial bones aren't exactly fused just yet, that occurs a little bit later in life. So, it may be a good idea to take another look at the cranial lecture, so that you understand all of the different cranial diagnosis and the motions of the cranial bones. This can really come into play when we start talking about the cranial nerves. If there's a cranial dysfunction, it's possible that that can lead to a cranial nerve impairment, which you may be able to see in one of your pediatric patients. So, without getting too deep and going over all of the cranial nerves again, here's a simple way to draw out some of the functions of the cranial nerves. So, if you can see it kind of looks like a face, so one -- cranial nerve one helps with smelling and this is located where the nose would be. Two, three, four and six around the eyes, five the whole face, seven the whole head, eight for hearing, 11 for your accessory nerve helping out the muscles of the neck and then you have three more. You have cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12. These are written in red because specifically for Pediatrics if there's some sort of an impairment of cranial nerve nine, 10 and or 12, you may see trouble feeding and latching in newborns. So, if you see a patient with feeding and latching issues as a newborn, they may be trying to get you to think about cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12 impairment. Now there is a specific combination between cranial nerves and possible cranial bones that are dysfunctional. There's a nice chart that we have in the notes that goes over everything, but in reality the cranial nerves overlap with a lot of different bones. Some of the bones that you need to be aware of is going to be the temporal bone, occipital and the sphenoid. It will be important for you to be able to match up a cranial nerve impairment dysfunction based off of the findings and then be able to figure out which cranial bone you may want to target your treatment towards, because there's such an overlap it's going to be really difficult for exam writers to figure out a good combination. So more than likely they're going to give you an impairment of a nerve with a combination of a bone to treat, but if you're ever super stuck and in doubt most cranial nerves can be treated by treating the temporal bone. So, if you're ever super stuck pick temporal. The next COMAT is going to be the psych COMAT. Now on the psych COMAT what sort of patient may you see? Someone with depression or anxiety. So, if a patient has depression, it's been shown that osteopathically they'll have a decreased cranial rhythm and they will have shallow and short breaths. So imagine this, a depressed patient can come in, cranial rhythmic impulse is going to be depressed. They may be hunched over, slouching, taking short rapid breaths. One thing that the exam writers may be trying to get you to think of is assessing for cranial function. So, if you see a depressed patient with a decreased CRI, make the connection that they're wanting you to assess cranial function. If you see the patient has difficulty breathing with shallow or short breaths, you should immediately think of respiration. So, make the connection here that a depressed patient with depressed breathing, they may have a respiratory dysfunction. Remember back to the ribs lecture where we talked about how to diagnose the ribs, dysfunctional sacrum, dysfunctional SCM. If you see that presentation make the connection and think of those topics specifically. The next COMAT is going to be surgery. Common patient that you're going to have on the surgery COMAT is a post-operative patient. There are three presentations that you would need to be aware of. Post-op atelectasis, wound healing and post-operative ileus. When you take the surgery COMAT, you're probably going to see a patient that has some of this. You need to be making some osteopathic thoughts about patients with these dysfunctions. So, if you see a presentation for post-op atelectasis, they're trying to get you to think about respiration again. You need to try and prevent post-op atelectasis. You can do that by improving their breathing, treat the ribs, treat the diaphragm, treat the SCM, potentially perform rib bracing. Go back to the ribs lecture if you want a more in-depth review. So once again respiration. Now wound healing. You need to be able to promote wound healing throughout the entire body for the patient. What you're going to have to do to promote wound healing is treat the lymphatic system. If you need a better refresher on lymphatics, go back to the lymphatics video. So, if you see wound healing think about treating the lymphatics. This means treat the choke points and perform some pumps, get the fluid moving again. Now post-operative ileus. They're trying to get you to think of the autonomic nervous system and patient facilitation. So, when you see the word atelectasis think of facilitation, think of excess sympathetic flow to the intestines. So post-op ileus, think of autonomic nervous system. Now the levels that you should pay particular attention to are T5 through T9 and T10 and T11. So, these two autonomic levels are where the majority of the organs in the abdomen are going to be located and where the majority of your general surgery questions will come from. If you need a better in-depth review of the autonomic nervous system, go back to the autonomic lesson. So, some Chapman's points that you'll definitely see on your surgery COMAT. You should be aware of the liver, the gallbladder, pancreas, the kidney and the appendix. You have Chapman's points on the anterior side and the posterior side. For the liver, these Chapman's points are located on the fifth and sixth rib interspaces on the right side of the body. On the posterior side, these are located on the fifth and sixth transverse processes on the right side. The gallbladder is located in the sixth interspace on the right side. On the posterior side, it's T6 on the right transverse process. For the pancreas, it's the seventh rib interspace on the right and on the posterior side, it's T7 transverse process on the right. For the kidney, this is the location that's one inch lateral and one inch superior to the umbilicus on the anterior side and on the posterior side it's on L1 transverse process bilaterally. Don't forget the appendix on the anterior side, it's on the tip of rib 12 on the right and on the posterior side it's on the lateral portion of rib 11 on the right. Now moving to the OB COMAT. Now on the OB COMAT it's safe to say that you're going to have some patients who are moms, who are pregnant, or maybe are new mothers, so moms. The patient presentation that you may see would be lower back pain and potentially some sort of autonomic facilitation. So autonomic nervous system facilitation. Now if you see this presentation, the exam writers might be trying to get you to think about the sacrum. So, the sacrum is going to move to compensate for pregnancy. When you're pregnant, the sacrum will bilaterally extend in order to compensate needed the extra room. Once that you've given birth, the sacrum will by laterally flex forward. So, when pregnant, bilaterally extended sacrum. After birth, the mom may have a bilaterally flexed sacrum. Now this motion of the sacrum is normal, but if it stays in these locations for an extended period of time, it can become dysfunctional and if it's dysfunctional that can lead to lower back pain and potentially some autonomic facilitation. If you need a refresher on the sacrum, take a look at the sacrum lesson. If you need a refresher on autonomics, take a look at the on anomic lesson. So, if you have a pregnant patient or a new mom who has lower back pain or autonomic facilitation, think of the sacrum. So, if you're thinking autonomics some important levels to remember are T10 through T11 for the gonads and T12 through L2 for the rest of the sex organs. Now to finish this up with some Chapman's points that you will probably see on the COMAT, you should know the Chapman's point for the uterus, the ovary, the vagina and the broad ligament. You should know the anterior Chapman's point and the posterior Chapman's point. For the uterus, the anterior Chapman's point is on the IT band and on the posterior side, it's the transverse process of L5 bilaterally. For the ovary, the anterior Chapman's point is on the pubic tubercle and on the posterior side it's the transverse process of T10 bilaterally. For the vagina the anterior side, it's on the IT band and the posterior side it's on the PSIS. For the broad ligament the anterior side is the IT band and posterior side is the PSIS. Now it may be possible that you would see a newborn on your OB exam. If you do just remember the cranial nerve findings. So, what about the internal exam and family and the OMM COMAT? For these COMATs, it's probably a good idea just to know everything. If you've made it this far into the lessons, you should have a pretty good understanding of osteopathy and the core concepts so that you can be prepared to answer any question that you see whether it's something that you've already studied or maybe something new that's going to require a little bit of understanding of core concepts for you to work out the correct answer. So, on the IE and family and OMM COMATs, it's a good idea to just know everything. Obviously, this isn't an all-inclusive list of what OMM things you may see on each COMAT, but this is a pretty good starting point for you. On Pediatrics, it's a good idea to take a look at the cranial nerves and cranial dysfunctions, noting that cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12 will affect feeding and latching. For the psych exam may be a good idea to look at cranial and respiration. For surgery, you want to avoid post-operative complications by looking at respirations, lymphatics and autonomic nervous system. For OB make sure that you take a look at that sacrum and for IE and family and OMM, you should probably just know everything and that's OMM for the specialties. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Tips for the PE]  
﻿The dreaded PE. I'm sure just talking about it is inducing stress in you right now. You have to see a certain number of patients in a short amount of time and oh yeah, as a DO student you need to bring in OMM and treat your patients using osteopathic techniques. As an OMM teaching fellow one of my roles was to take students who have previously failed the PE and help them pass on their next attempt. Now I'm going to give you my tips and tricks on how you can pass the PE and look forward to the OMM sections as easy points on test day. So, the first thing that you need to know is communication and there are two people that you need to communicate with on your exam day. The first one is the patient. Now if you have an osteopathic patient who's there to be seen for an osteopathic reason, they may try and tip you off by saying I heard your DO tell me about that, or maybe they'll say I had a friend who is treated with OMT. What is it? Can it help me? You need to be able to anticipate this question and come up with a quick elevator speech to give a quick demonstration of what osteopathy is and why you think it can be helpful for your patient. So, you need to think up an elevator speech. Now for a full elevator speech that I use you can take a look at the notes, but some quick tips that may help you out is saying that it's a hands-on treatment approach you can use it in the office today. It can help push your patient into a position where the body will heal itself. Things not to say is "Oh, it's like a chiropractor, but a little different" don't say that, you'll lose your points. Think up an elevator speech before PE day, so that when you get the question, you know what you're going to say. The next thing that you need to communicate is what you're doing and why? So, imagine this, you're going to the clinic with some sort of a complaint. The physician wants to give you a medication, but doesn't tell you what it is? Why he's going to give it to you? Or how he thinks it's going to help. It seems pretty crazy. It's the same thing with OMM. You need to be able to explain to your patient what you're doing and why you're doing it in terms that they can understand. So, you can't say you feel flex and side bend and rotated, they're not osteopathic physicians. They won't know what you're talking about, but you can say it feels like you can't move in this direction. I can perform a treatment that can help restore your range of motion. That would be better. So, think of something to say for what and why. The second person that you need to communicate with is the grader. Now the person grading the OMM portion of your PE is not going to be in the room with you. He's not going to be behind you palpating all of your palpatory findings. So, you need to be able to explain what you're feeling and why you are going to move on to whatever treatment plan based on that. The whole idea of the OMM portion of the PE is to see if you can take the palpatory findings and make a logical connection between that and what treatment technique you want to use and why you want to do it. So, you're helping yourself out if you say your findings out loud and then you go through your treatment out loud, so the grader can follow along logically. Now remember you can't say out loud flex, side bend and rotate, you can say their positional findings. So, it's in the patient terms, but just say it in a way that the grader can understand what you're saying. So, make sure that you say everything out loud. So, the next tip to keep in mind is variety. Now the OMM portion of the PE is to see if you have an understanding of osteopathic techniques. If you go in on PE day and for all of your osteopathic patients you perform counterstrain, you're not showing that you have a very wide knowledge of osteopathy in general. You're showing that you know how to perform counterstrain pretty well. That's not going to get you the points that you need on test day in order to pass. You need to show a variety. So maybe use a muscle energy technique, maybe use an indirect technique like FPR, use counterstrain, use myofascial, use a combination with all of your patients. Don't just stick to one treatment style but mix it up a little bit. So, some general tips is that each of your treatment should only take between three and five minutes. Don't kill all of your time with the patient trying to set up and perform as perfect treatment. Only stick to three to five minutes. You don't want to run out of time. One treatment that's easy to do is muscle energy. So, muscle energy is pretty easy. You put them into the barrier. You have them isometrically contract into the freedom. Do it three to five times, back to neutral, re-screen. So, this is a pretty easy autopilot that you can go onto to treat your patient osteopathically using muscle energy. You can also anticipate different treatments for different body parts that you may not have already learned. Just know put them in the barrier and to have them isometrically contract into the freedom. So, muscle energy is easy. Next is counterstrain. Now counterstrain is a good technique to use, but you need to plan ahead. Remember counterstrain takes a full 90 seconds. It's not like lab where you can say 1, 2, 89, 90. If you're in the PE and you perform counterstrain you need to make sure that you hold for the full 90 seconds. Now that 90 seconds can be detrimental if you're short on time, but it can also be very beneficial for you if you use it properly. During that 90 seconds you can explain your treatment plan, what you're doing, why you're doing it. You can communicate your entire thought process with the patient during that time. Don't sit there in silence, that's too awkward. Make sure that you use your time efficiently. So, if you do counterstrain, make sure to plan ahead for that full 90 seconds. Now one treatment technique that you don't want to use is HVLA. Now they say this rule everywhere when you're prepping for the PE. Don't use HVLA. It's a high-stress environment, so you may forget, but I'm telling you again. Don't use HVLA. The standardized patients are being seen by 12 students in the morning, maybe even 12 students in the afternoon. They're not going to feel very good at the end of the day if their back is being popped 24 times. Don't use HVLA, you're going to lose points and fail on that patient. So, no HVLA. Now your final treatment technique is myofascial. A myofascial is also pretty easy to use. It can be indirect, direct, active, passive really seems like you can just make up whatever you want to do for whatever muscle, but this technique is also incredibly easy for you to perform. So, in reality you should probably only use it once. Use Myofascial as your panic button. If you can't think of anything else and you freeze, go with myofascial one time. Don't use it on more than one patient, it's too easy and no matter what treatment technique you decide to do, every treatment ends exactly the same. You need to re-screen. You always need to re-screen your patient after every single treatment. You have to assess for efficacy and see if you actually did anything or not. If you did something your treatment was effective. If you didn't do anything, you might need to throw in another treatment. So, the next bit of advice is to anticipate. Now the PE rooms are set up in an ambulatory setting, so it's a good idea to anticipate some treatments that you may have to perform on your patients. Now here's where a little bit of truth comes into play. They're standardized patients. They may say that they have knee pain and they're there to be seen for an osteopathic treatment, but it's a standardized patient. They may or may not actually have somatic dysfunction findings for knee pain. So, it's really important in real life and in the PE that you screen every single patient, every single time. That way you can assess for any somatic dysfunction that you find and if you say your findings out loud, the greater can understand what you palpated and why you're deciding to treat that instead of whatever complaint that came in with. Remember the body is a big tensegrity unit. It's possible that back pain can cause knee pain. So just because they said knee, don't focus in on the knee. Make sure that you screen every patient, every time. So, screen your patients. Now going back to anticipation, what are some clinical things that you may see in an ambulatory setting. We'll draw out some examples. So, in the ambulatory setting there's a variety of reasons why a patient may come in with a complaint and you can potentially treat it osteopathically. So pretty good idea is to anticipate something that you may see. The patient comes in with a headache. You may be able to treat that using cranial. You can even perform a suboccipital release and if they complain of something like a cold or flu-like symptoms a facial sinus effleurage may be helpful. If they come in with an ear complaint, may be a good idea to perform the gall breath technique. If they come in with neck pain, you can start thinking about treating the cervical spine with muscle energy or any other treatment modality that you would like to use, or you can target your treatment at the SCM or the TRAPS. If a patient comes in with shoulder pain after they've been playing sports or maybe they were in a motor vehicle collision, take a look at the scapula and assess for a somatic dysfunction. Maybe even perform the Spencer technique in the shoulder, or maybe perform some counterstrain for the SITS muscles. If a patient comes in with back pain, there are plenty of different treatments that you can use for back pain, but this may be a good time for you to show your osteopathic variety and use something different than muscle energy. Maybe try an indirect technique like Still or FPR. So, let's do FPR for the T-spine. Maybe the patient has been coughing, because they've had a cold for the past couple weeks and now their chest hurts on the outside, maybe think of a rib dysfunction. So maybe you should screen the ribs and assess for a somatic dysfunction there. Let's say they were skateboarding, and they fell forward now their elbow hurts, maybe take a look at their radial head and treat that with muscle energy. Now remember the body is a big tensegrity unit. Pain in one place can cause pain or somatic dysfunction in another. If a patient presents with wrist pain, it would still be logical to check out the radial head. So, if you see a patient who might be complaining of wrist pain, maybe take a look at the radial head too, or maybe you could perform a carpal tunnel release. Maybe the patient has some hip pain after a long road trip, or maybe they fell going down the stairs. If they have some hip and pelvic pain, maybe take a look at the sacrum with the seated flexion test or maybe even the innominates with the standing flexion test. Take a look at the piriformis or psoas and you already know plenty of techniques to treat all of these locations, because you've already been through the video lessons up until this point. Maybe the patient comes in with knee pain after they fell or maybe they were playing soccer. One good place to look is maybe the fibular head. You can maybe even perform some counterstrain on the knee ligaments and once again the body is a big tensegrity unit. If they come in with ankle pain, it would be logical for you to still assess the fibular head. If it's not the fibular head you can potentially do some more counterstrain on some of the ligaments of the ankle. So, we went over a lot in these PE tips. Hopefully this will help decrease your stress and make you look forward to the OMM section on your PE. Just remember that you need to communicate with the patient and the grader. You need to show variety in your osteopathic treatments. Make sure that you only use myofascial one time as your panic button. Anticipate by screening every single patient and going in there with some treatment ideas in your back pocket just in case and that's OMM tips for the PE. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Treatment Modalities]  
﻿We're going to do something pretty ambitious in this lecture. We're going to go over all of the high yield treatment styles that you're going to see in the clinic and while you're reading your textbooks. The purpose of this lecture is to give you an idea of all of the treatment styles and what makes them similar or different to one another. This lecture is also going to help you choose which treatment style you want to use for which sort of patient. This lecture is going to be a little bit longer, but it's set up like this on purpose so that we can go over everything all at once. During this lecture, the high yield points that you should pay particular attention to are which treatments are direct, indirect, active and passive. So to start off with, we're going to go over some quick vocabulary. So you can have an active treatment, means that the patient assists in the treatment. Meaning that at some point during an active treatment, you are going to ask the patient to do some sort of motion. A passive treatment is going to be the opposite. During a passive treatment, we're going to ask the patient just to remain completely still. At no point during the treatment do we ask the patient to do anything. There are two different types of treatment, and the first one is direct. The direct treatment is a treatment that directly engages the restrictive barrier. So remember, from the previous videos we were talking about how you always name a diagnosis based off what it can do. So the name of the diagnosis is the freedom. So the barrier is what they cannot do, so it's going to be the restriction. It's going to be the opposite of the freedom. So if the diagnosis is something like T6 flexed, rotated and side bending to the right, the barrier is going to be extended, rotating and side bending to the left. It's going to be the opposite. And indirect treatment is going to be the opposite. Instead of the engaging the barrier like we did for a direct treatment, we're going to engage the freedom, or what the patient can do. So why would you choose a direct treatment or an indirect treatment? It's going to depend on what sort of patient you see and what sort of dysfunction that they have. So the typical patient that you will choose a direct treatment for would be someone who's younger, who does not have too much pain during motion, and maybe even a dysfunction that's chronic. When you're doing a direct treatment, you're going to be engaging the barrier, or what they can't do. Sometimes this is a little bit painful or uncomfortable for the patient. If it's painful, then you're going to do something that's indirect. But if it's not painful, you can stick to direct. So indirect is going to be the opposite. You're going to do this for someone that may be older, who has pain with the dysfunction, and maybe something that's a little bit more acute. So if you think of an acute dysfunction, when it first happens it may be a little bit more painful than after you've been sitting on it for a while. So acute and painful, think indirect. Chronic, no pain, think of a direct treatment. So for the rest of this, we're going to go with one example, and I'm going to relate all of the treatments back to it so that you understand the barrier, the restriction, the freedom, all the vocabulary. So let's say that the dysfunction is going to be T7 FRS Right. So you always name it by what it can do. So T7 can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. This is the freedom. The opposite is what they cannot do, the restrictive barrier. So as I'm going through these examples, keep in mind direct, indirect, active, passive, barrier, freedom. So the first treatment style is going to be muscle energy. When I say muscle energy, what I want you to think of is isometric contraction. I want you to think of lengthening the muscle to engage the restrictive barrier and then an isometric contraction into the freedom that will then shorten the muscle. It'll make sense as I write this out. So there are two flavors of muscle energy. The first one is post-isometric relaxation. This is going to be a direct technique and also active. So this means that we are going to engage the barrier during treatment and we're going to ask the patient to move during the treatment and help us with the treatment. When you hear muscle energy, I want you to think of the golgi tendon organ. Without getting deep into the golgi tendon organ, it basically boils down to this. The golgi tendon organ recognizes that there is extra tension during treatment. It's going to tell the agonist muscle to relax, which is then going to allow the physician to move further into the barrier. So if you hear muscle energy, think golgi tendon organ. So how do I set up and perform this treatment? The first step is you are going to passively move the patient into the barrier. So the first step of the treatment is going to have the patient seated an relaxed so he is passive. You need to move him into the barrier. The barrier is what they cannot do. So if they can flex, rotate right, side bend right, they cannot extend, rotate left, side bend left. So the barrier is what they cannot do. The diagnosis is what they can do. Make sure you keep that straight. Once they are into the barrier, this is where you're going to ask the patient to assist during the treatment. You're going to have the patient actively isometrically contract to the freedom. So you have the patient engaged in the barrier already. You're going to ask the patient to move into the freedom. So move into the diagnosis, move into what they can do, which is flex, rotation right, side bend right. Remember from the previous lectures, we talked about what an isometric force is. So they're going to try and move in towards the freedom, but during treatment, you are going to hold them still and give them enough of a muscle force that keeps them in their position. So that's isometric. The patient pushes while the physician pushes, both forces cancel each other out and there's no motion. Once they actively move into the freedom for three to five seconds, you are then going to passively reengage the new barrier. So this is going to be the same barrier as before, but it's the new barrier since you can now go further into the barrier because of the golgi tendon organ telling the agonist muscle to relax. So new barrier, what they can't do, extended, rotate left, side bend left. The next step is going to repeat everything three to five times. Once you have performed the entire treatment three to five times, you can then bring the patient passively back to neutral and rescreen. At the end of every single treatment, whether it's muscle energy or anything else that we discuss, you have to rescreen and make sure that your treatment worked. So rescreen at the end of everything. So I said muscle energy comes in two flavors. You have post-isometric and reciprocal inhibition. This treatment style is going to be direct or indirect, but it will always be active. So direct or indirect, either engages the barrier or engages the freedom. You'll see the difference during setup. So if it's a direct treatment, you want to put the patient into the barrier during setup. So what's an example of this? The easiest way to think of reciprocal inhibition is going to be your biceps and your triceps. Your biceps will be the agonist muscle and the dysfunctional muscle, and your triceps will be the antagonist. So imagine that the patient has hypertonic biceps, meaning that they can go into flexion but they cannot go into extension. So if I'm going to directly engage the barrier, I'm going to ask the patient to do what they cannot do, which is go into the extension barrier. And then I'm going to have the patient contract their antagonist muscle, their triceps. If I want this to be an indirect treatment, I'm going to place the patient into what they can do, which is flexion, and then I'm going to ask them to engage their antagonist muscle, which is their triceps. So in reciprocal inhibition, you're always wanting to engage the antagonist muscle. In post isometric relaxation, your goal is to engage the agonist muscle. So for our example of the hypertonic bicep, if we want to directly engage the barrier, we're going to extend the bicep and flex the tricep. If I want this to be an indirect treatment, I'm going to place the patient into what they can do, which is a flexed bicep, and I'm still going to ask them to flex the tricep. Once you've done the treatment, you then put the patient back in a neutral and rescreen. So the next treatment style is going to be high velocity, low amplitude, or HVLA. Whenever we think about HVLA, think of the technique that causes the pops. So when we're talking about HVLA, think of popping and cracking. So HVLA. This type of treatment is going to be direct and passive. So during the treatment setup, we're going to engage the barrier and it's passive, we're not going to ask the patient to do anything. So the first step in this treatment is going to be passive motion into the barrier. So relating this back to our example, the patient's diagnosis is T7 flexed, rotated right, side bent right. This is what they can do. This is the freedom. So if we want to engage the barrier, we engage the opposite. So we'll want to engage extension, rotation left, side bending left. So the first step, passive to the barrier. The next step is to instruct the patient to relax, which mostly includes breathing techniques for them to relax. When you're trying to thrust through the barrier, it's a little bit easier when the patient is relaxed and their muscles aren't tense. Once you have the patient relaxed, then you are going to perform your HVLA thrust through the barrier. So we already have the patient in the barrier, which is extension, rotating left, side bending left. So the HVLA thrust goes through the barrier. So your thrust will further push them into extension, rotation left, side bending left. This thrust is what's going to cause your pop. After the treatment, bring them back to neutral and rescreen. So the next treatment style is facilitated positional release, or FPR. This treatment style is going to be a little bit different than muscle energy and HVLA. It's going to be indirect and passive. So this treatment is indirect. What we've previously been talking about is direct. So instead of engaging the barrier like we did for muscle energy and HVLA, we're going to set the patient up into the freedom first. So the first step is going to be passively moving the patient into the freedom. So for our example, T7 can flex, can rotate to the right, can side bend to the right. So we're going to passively move them into what they can do. So flexed, rotated right, side bent right. They're now into the freedom. The next step is going to add an activating force. So what's an activating force? When you're performing your treatment, you just add compression down to the segment of dysfunction. So that can be from the head and neck or that can be from the shoulders for any of the dysfunctions lower down in the spine. So you add the compression force next. In this example, T7 is dysfunctional, so you need to make sure that your compression force goes down to T7 for the treatment. Once you add the activating force, you are then going to passively move the patient further into the freedom. So you're going to put the patient into the freedom, what they can do. You add the activating force. With the activating force, you push them further into the freedom. So add the activating force, push them further into flexion, rotation to the right and side bending to the right. Once you do that, the treatment's been complete, so now you can passively return them back to neutral and then rescreen. So you release your force, return to neutral, and always rescreen. The next treatment style is going to be balanced ligamentous tension, or BLT. This treatment's going to be similar to FPR in that it's an indirect technique. So this treatment is indirect and passive. So like FPR where it's indirect, but not like muscle energy or HVLA that's direct. So for BLT, indirect, engage the freedom. The next step that you're going to do is engage the freedom in three planes of motion. So think about three planes of the motion of the diagnosis. You have flexion extension, rotation, and side bending. We're going to engage the freedom where it makes the tissues all neutral during your first step of the treatment. So indirect, what they can do, first step is passive on three planes. Once they're in the freedom for the three planes of motion, the next thing you do is just hold and wait for the release. Once they feel the release or the softening of the tissues, you then bring them back to neutral and rescreen. So again, with our treatment example, T7 is flexed, rotated right, side bent right. The three planes of motion that you're going to engage, flexion, rotation right, side bending right, into the freedom. Hold it there until you feel a release. Once that you do, neutral and rescreen. The next treatment is going to be still technique. Now still is going to be a little bit different. It's both direct and indirect, as well as being a passive treatment. So during this treatment, you're going to engage both the direct barrier or what they cannot do, and the indirect barrier or the freedom, what they can do, what the diagnosis is. So the first step of the treatment is going to be to passively move the patient into the freedom. So for our example, T7, they can flex, rotate right, side bend right. Put them into the freedom, so put them into flex, rotate right, side bent right. The next step is going to be to add an activating force. Once you have the activating force applied, this is where the direct portion of the treatment will begin. You add the activating force and then you move the patient into the direct barrier. So in this treatment so far, you have the patient what they can do, flex, rotate right, side bend right. You add the activating force and then you move the patient further into the barrier or what they cannot do, which will be extension, rotation left, side bending left. So now passive through barrier. Once there, you can then release your activating force, bring the patient back to neutral, and then you rescreen. Always rescreen. So up until now, all of the treatment styles we've talked about, I want you to think of using when you're treating something in the spine or some sort of a joint. The next three treatment styles we're going to go over, I want you to think about treatment a muscular dysfunction instead of treating a spinal dysfunction. So think muscle for the next three. This next one is going to be counter-strain. So counter-strain is an indirect treatment that is also passive. Now we have a whole video devoted strictly to counter-strain that comes on later in the series. But for right now, I want you to think of indirect treatment that's also passive. So if you're doing an indirect treatment, you put the dysfunction where it can go. If it's a hypertonic muscle, what it can do is bring the two ends of the muscle closer together. So for a counter-strain treatment, you're whole goal is to bring two ends of the muscle closer together. We're going to do this by folding and holding, or just shortening the muscle however we can. So when you think of counter-strain, think of fold and hold, which will shorten the muscle. The next treatment style is just going to be stretching. Now imagine stretch as just being the opposite of counter-strain. It's going to be a direct treatment. The whole goal is to elongate the muscle. So you're going to take the attachment and the origin and take them further apart by stretching the muscle. This can be accomplished by doing the opposite of whatever the muscle usually does. For example, if the bicep normally flexes, if I'm trying to stretch it I'm going to do the opposite. I'm going to extend it. So stretch is direct and passive. Your whole goal is to elongate the muscle. In this last treatment, it's really just about anything that you want it to be. It's myofascial. This can be direct or indirect, it can be active or passive. It all depends on how you set up the patient for treatment and if you're going to ask the patient to assist you or not. So myofascial. This can be direct or indirect and can be passive or active. In this treatment, you're going to move the muscles around in three planes of motion, including traction, rotation and compression. For a more indepth example, look later on in the series at the lumbar lecture. So how are we going to make this direct or indirect? It's easy. You either engage the barrier or you engage the freedom. So three planes of motion, which include traction, rotation and compression. Direct to the barrier or where the tissues cannot go, and indirect into the freedom. So when you're performing this technique and you're putting the patient directly into the barrier, you're going to put the tissue where it doesn't want to go. When you're pushing in that direction, you're going to have a hard end feel. It's going to feel very taut when you move that way. Indirect, you engage the freedom, when you move the tissues in that direction, it softens or loosens. So how do you make this treatment active or passive? This is where you use enhancers. So what's an enhancer? An enhancer is during your myofascial treatment, you ask the patient to contract whatever muscle you're treating. So for example, let's say you're doing myofascial to the diaphragm. You're doming it and pushing your fingers into the diaphragm. If you want them to contract, you can have them actively help you in treatment by deep inhaling and deep exhaling. This movement is going to make the treatment active and it's an enhancer. So enhancers make the treatment active. So these are all of the treatment styles that we're going to go over. You have muscle energy, where you think of post-isometric relaxation and reciprocal inhibition. Always think of isometric contraction. HVLA, think of the popping. FPR, where it's all indirect. BLT where you have the three planes of motion. Still technique where it's both direct and indirect. Move on to the muscular treatments, you have counter-strain which is fold and hold, stretching which is elongating the muscle, and myofascial which is really the grab bag of everything. So the important part of this is that you understand the concepts of direct, indirect, active and passive. So we're going to make a big chart with everything. So we have muscle energy, HVLA, FPR, BLT, still, counter-strain, stretch and myofascial. And each treatment can either be direct, indirect, passive or active. So what about muscle energy? Direct, indirect, active or passive? When you think muscle energy, think of it being direct, but also know that occasionally it can be indirect. This is an active treatment because the patient is actively helping you. He's doing some sort of muscle contraction. When you think of HVLA, it's direct, you're directly engaging the barrier, the treatment is passive because the patient relaxes, the patient doesn't do anything. FPR is indirect where you engage the freedom, and it's passive because the patient does not help you during treatment. BLT is the same, where it's all indirect and it's a passive treatment. Still is the weird one where it's both direct and indirect. Although when you're thinking of still technique in the clinic or on an exam or wherever else, think of still as being an indirect technique. But just know that it's both. So if you get asked to do an indirect technique and still is an option, think of indirect still technique. This technique is also passive, he doesn't help. Counter-strain is going to be indirect, where you engage the freedom and you shorten the muscle, and it's going to be passive where the patient does not help you. The stretch, you're elongating the muscle and doing what it cannot do. That's going to be direct and it's going to be passive, because the patient is not going to help. The myofascial, everything, depending on however you set it up. So it's direct, indirect, passive, or if you want to use enhancers, active. One final quick thought is treatment sequencing. When you're treating something, you always want to think of sequencing by starting centrally and working your way out peripherally. So just as an example, if I want to treat something in the hand and I'm thinking of sequencing, start in the thoracic area, then move out to the shoulder, then upper extremity, then your hand distal dysfunction. You want to do this in order to make sure that you hit all of the compensatory patterns along the way. So if you get asked about sequencing, think central, work out peripheral. So to sum up everything in this massive lecture, we talked about all the high yield treatment styles. We discussed active, passive, direct and indirect, which are your main things that you have to know about each treatment. Why you would use direct or indirect. We went through examples with all of them, and then we also did a chart that has everything that's super high yield. And that's OMM treatment techniques. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Beating Clinical Vignettes]  
﻿The reason why I enjoy teaching clinical medicine so much is that it does prepare you for both life and the test but the NBME shelves and the USMLE step two licensing exams common the form of Clinical Vignettes. Now, I actually think they've done a pretty good job of taking an automated test to a testing center that tests both knowledge and reasoning as best as a multiple choice question can. Specifically though, how you score on a multiple choice exam does not determine your value as a physician and it does not assess your clinical reasoning or your ability to practice medicine but those scores do matter in getting into residency. So as you begin to prepare for these exams, it'd be useful if you prepared for the exams and yes, that's learning the knowledge but also, learning how to beat the test by using good test taking strategy. I don't say this to brag but I took my internal medicine boards, a nine-hour exam in three and half hours and people ask me how do I prepare for a medicine board exam and I said I made OnlineMedEd, you probably shouldn't copy that pattern, it's pretty hard but at the same time having learned how to write questions in residency and practice writing them, I was able to take those tests much faster and much more efficiently and still get the answer right. I'll show you how. First, we want to learn how the test writer writes the question? How to write a question? The first thing a test writer does is determines what the educational objective it's going to be. It may be something as vague as how do you diagnose a CHF exacerbation? Or what medications do you use to treat coronary artery disease? Or it could be something very specific like in [indiscernible] how do you anticoagulate a fib and who do you anticoagulate in? But they choose an educational objective and that is going to be the question they ask. Then they choose a right answer and that's usually going to be in the way of what is the best next step in the management, how do you treat, how do you diagnose, what is the diagnosis or something as simple as polypharmacy is bad, how do you avoid doing unnecessary things in the elderly? There's going to be one right answer and notice the vignette hasn't even been considered yet but this is what they do, educational objective first, then the right answer. Then they're going to write the wrong answers. The wrong answers are called distractors, a good distractor is one that it sounds attractive to someone who only has lose word association. That is if you only study buzzwords, you're going to get pulled into a trap. Wheezing asthma? They're going to give you a wheeze, but it won't be asthma, because they know that word association exists and they'll purposefully change of in yet to make it non-asthma even though there's wheezing or distractor is the right thing to do for a disease, just not at that time. Esophageal varices should be given propranolol or nadolol as an outpatient, turning an acute hemorrhage, they should not be given. Esophageal varices one vignette makes nadolol the right answer, one makes it absolutely the wrong answer. So a distractor is one that sound attractive or could be right if the vignette was adjusted a little bit and then they build the vignette and in that vignette what they're going to do is include the positives that are required for the right answer. The elements of the illness script for the right answer will be present and then they're going to spend a little bit of time making sure that those that the detractors, the wrong answers are listed as negative and this is very important. Even in the electronic exams they don't have 10 minutes per question. So they cannot write you a full history in physical. It's only couple of lines. So in those couple of lines, they need to make it clear that one answer is right and all the other answers are wrong and the idea will be that you will get the things you need in that vignette at the USMLE step one and two level, there are no curve balls. What they give you is what they need. So you start stacking up the things that go along with the right answer and you start crossing off the wrong answers because the things you should be looking for aren't there. This is also the danger of getting other Qbanks. We do not mold our questions that is to say as we'll talk about in a minute how do you learn from these questions. We test one educational objective one way and then we explain in the answers why the other ones are wrong for that one vignette and what you can do to change the vignette to make that distractor correct. In that way we make five questions out of one but we only give you one question a lot of Qbanks in order to pad their numbers ask the same question again, only tweak two things and make a different answer right and it's a new question, we don't do that but recognize it's also based on a hinge. Most of the time, you have to know the diagnosis from the vignette MI? Before you can ask the hinge what medication impairs mortality, beta blocker? What's the most common cause of death in 24 hours? What's the pathology look like after a week? What's Dressler's syndrome. They can ask all of these questions based on the same vignette which says, this person is having an MI. Okay. So this is how they write the questions. How should you actually take the exam? The first thing you're going to do and I say this with great emphasis because even my own residence don't do this, we have the question of the day, even after me poking and prawning and making them do it, they still do it out of order. The first thing you should do is read the question? Read the question first, that is always going to be the last line of the vignette. Read the question, the hinge first, then read the options, the answer choices next. What's you're doing is priming your brain. You want to at least know what universe you're in and usually it's going to be along the same question of what is the best next step in management and if what you see as answer choices are iron, IV estrogen, uterine artery ligation transfusion, you know it has something to do with uterine bleeding. Whereas if you saw aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, low molecular weight heparin therapeutic dose, you're probably in the coronary artery disease section and so first, you should be able to identify that this is OB, this is cardiology but then if you can identify the educational objective and then only once you've read the answer choices and the question do you then go back and read the vignette. To prove a point, I know this has happened to everyone, think about that time you read the vignette and you are so excited because you knew what the diagnosis was, you're highlighting all the things that were right for that diagnosis, you're like, okay, this is a stroke, I got it and then it asks you what seizure medicine should you give? And you're like, huh? I thought this question is about stroke? Well, you wasted that entire time which you had go back, undo all you're highlighting and read the vignette again, because, oh, my God it's not at all what I thought or that time you're completely lost in that vignette and you have no idea what's going on and then only after you read the question and the answer choices because you start narrowing them down. Often, you can narrow it down to one or two just by reading the question and the answer choices and then as you go through the vignette having already primed your brain with the universe and educational objective, you're looking for those pertinent positives and pertinent negatives. In the case, in order to help you forget what the right answer is, that's how you can accelerate and not get trapped when five things fit and one thing is off, because you're looking for multiple things in and if the vignette gives you five things that points you to one direction, that's where they're going for. The last question is going to be how do you learn or how do you use a Qbank. There are two ways to use a Qbank. The first one is to learn. The second one is to practice. Questions must be done to do well On STEP. You have to practice doing questions in order to do the questions. Very much like a boxer has to train in the gym sparring in order to actually prepare for the fight. If he does a bunch of skipping rope, he's going to have great cardio but he won't have any technique. So you have to do the thing that happens on game day. You must practice. But to use questions, a Qbank to learn involves this. You should do the Qbank untimed and with tutor mode on, so that every question you do, you follow the same path, read the question, read the answers then read the vignette, select an answer and read the entirety of the explanation. Don't feel satisfied ha, I guessed right this time. What you want to be able to do is say, I know why the right answer is right, I also know how to change the vignette to make the other answers wrong and a lot of Qbanks, even very advanced ones, just tell you why the answer is wrong but they don't tell you it's a good distractor. They just tell you why it was stupid and you never pick it. Instead a good well-written question is going to have four distractors which are all legit and the explanations to tell you why those distractors are wrong this time and what you could do to make them right. If you're going to use a Qbank for practice it should be timed, tutor mode off and you read only the answer explanations of the ones you've got wrong. The idea as we'll discuss in the next lesson is that when you're learning, you want to engage all the material. When you're practicing, what you want to do is feel what it's like to take 44 questions in a row. To do it seven times in a row and when you get fidgety, when do you start freaking out? When do you need to take a break? How long a break do you need to take? How well can you attend two blocks in a row? Is that a good idea? You're not trying to get any more knowledge force in here, you're just simulating what it's like to take the test, where in learning you want to go slow and make sure you engage all the explanations to maximize that learning. Okay. So we spent a lot of time on how to write the question and if you know how people write the question it makes sense then on how to take it. Read the question and the answer choices looking for the educational objective, you can generally narrow it down to two or three answers, then you read the vignette looking for the things that you expect in the illness script, the things that we taught you in the videos and in the notes that are then going to increase or decrease the likelihood that that one is the right answer and you pick the one that has the most pluses and to use a Qbank, decide whether you're going to learn, go slow, be thorough or practice, get through them, feel what it's like to take the test. That is Education Questions. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Intro to Education]  
﻿At OnlineMedEd we have created an adult learning paradigm that maximizes effectiveness and efficiency. It's based on adult educational theory, research in the field who haven't made this thing haphazardly and if you follow the script we give you, follow the schedule, do exactly what we say, you're going to do well but not everyone is going to commit like that. So, what I want to do in the next series of lessons is show you what's out there, that is give you the concepts, the maps behind why you'd pick one thing over another. I believe that most medical students as they enter medical school know how they want to study, in groups, in pairs, on their own, questions, reading, lessons, videos, lectures, whatever you're learning style. The problem is you've made those conclusions in an environment that was based on the wrong thing, 45 minute long PowerPoint lectures given in a dark room in one hour slots where you had to start when the lecture was ready. Which means you probably played Clash of Clans, checked your email and went on to ESPN.com rather than paying attention or you just didn't go at all because that's not how you study. As I say, most medical students succeed in spite of their medical school not because of and so what I want to do is explore the things that are going to get you to succeed and this is useful because success at this point in your life is not about getting a score, step two scores matter, they do but at this point, it's about learning the foundations for the rest of your life. So, test success and life success are obtained the same way. So, this introduction just gives the outline of what the next series is going to look like, we're going to talk about study materials that is resources. What's out there, what are the different types of resources or study materials and how do you best utilize them. Of course, since the USMLE step two is all about multiple choice questions and vignettes. We are going to talk about clinical vignettes, how they're written and once you understand how they're written, you can understand how to take the test better and also how to benefit from doing questions, more in that in that lecture. We're also going to talk about the phases of learning and this is more about STEP prep than it is life prep, the idea being that you need to have rigorous study periods and then also training for test day where that rigorous training is going to be what you're going to do for the rest of your life as you learn the medicine in your chosen field but then also understand that there is a right away to prepare for test day and if you know what you're doing, you can plan accordingly and lastly, to sort of set some schedules, that is what is your actual goal and how much are you willing to commit to studying, how much time do you have and then you can build the right schedule for the right goal. Both of these are more a STEP prep than they are life and then OnlineMedEd is not based haphazardly on something we made up, right, it's based on adult education theory and so, for those of you who want to know why we do what we do in the way we do it and why it's so effective and so efficient, this won't help you practically but at least you'll know some insight behind what we do, there's the final fifth video called educational theory. So in the next couple of lectures I'm going to show you our paradigm and why we do what we do. Even if you don't want to use our paradigm, you want to do whatever you want, I want you walking away with a good concept of what's the right way to use resources, what are my realistic goals and how hard am I going to have to work and based on those goals what should I actually do rather than rely on whatever recommendation came from the class before and what do you got and he was one class above you and he thinks they did pretty well. That is Introduction to Education. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Making Sense of Educational Resources]  
﻿You can find the written version of this on your dashboard in the resources tab on the shelf and STEP prep study guide. What I want to talk about here are the different resources that are out there and I don't mean like name the brands, I mean identify and quantify what resources are available and how you should use them. Everyone is going to learn differently, everyone's going to prefer one over another but I want you walking away from this lesson knowing what your options are and how best to use them and we'll finish off with our learning paradigm and why we've chosen to do that. Well first, since learning usually occurs self-directed in medical school, is books but it's important you understand the different types of books that are out there and there are three kinds. There's the review book, the reading book and the reference book. The idea here is that as you go down the list you go up on the detail. First and foremost, never use a reference book to study. The only time you should touch a reference book is when you are asked to give a detailed talk to your team and only the specialist on the team is going to understand when you speak and everyone is going to be completely bored by you. Reference books are those ones that are online, but also things like Harrison's for medicine and Williams for gynecology. The tones that are so enormous they're not even worth reading and some people will tell you, you should read those reference books. No, you should not. You will not have the time to get through them and even if you do you're not going to remember anything from them. Reference books are about truth, not understanding. Everything we do here is about understanding and retention. Reference books, good for truth, truth you don't need as a medical student. You need black and white, yes-no, classic illness scripts. Not all the details about everything all the time. So the two were going to engage are the review books and the reading books, and the review books are going to be there primarily for memory that is repetition and retention. You've seen these review books, you've probably used one for step one. That's going to be things like first aid step up. The review book traditionally is just the bulleted lists tables, if you read the review book without ever having gauged the content, you wouldn't know what anything meant and some people like to use it as a way to prime, I don't recommend that. Instead, what I recommend is that you learn the material well and then you engage that review book to trigger memory cues and on OnlineMedEd, this is called quick tables. The reading book is the thing that takes a narrative form; complete sentences paragraphs, pictures, diagrams, but it's not so much that you can't get through it, ACP essentials is a great example of this, if you start talking about Harrison's and Williams' and Schwartz, no go. At OnlineMedEd these reading materials are the notes and the notes are in eight and a half by eleven, one-page or two-page per lesson. Small amount of reading to do but the idea is you read the material to get acquainted with it before you then go on to learn it. We all know about lecturers. Right? And this is sort of why OnlineMedEd was created in the first place because we've all been through those in-person lectures. Now, you know that person who lectures phenomenally and you get so excited, when like that person is going to give a lecture the whole class shows up and they lecture for an hour but you've been there, an hour-long PowerPoint talks in a dark room where you either fall asleep because the guy is going on and on and on about some detail you don't care about or you check your email or ESPN, so we're getting rid of that. Now, of course being in person if you're very good at it is that there's a value added but most of the time in-person lectures are going to be really the person who has memorized their PowerPoint and drones on and on. So instead, we put our lectures online and the online lectures, that is the videos which are free allow you, the learner, to start, stop, repeat, speed up or whatever, you're in total control as opposed to starting when the lecturer is ready, you start when you're ready and being audiovisual it gives you another ahead at the stuff you had just read in the notes. Being in medical school, I know you know this already but to succeed you must do questions but it is important that you do not just do questions, you must do a USMLE style vignettes. What that means is not there's a very long paragraph that's obnoxious and describe something, what I mean is that it has to be a second order question. What is the best next step? What is the diagnosis? That is, you must first make the diagnosis from the vignette then they ask you a question, a detail about the thing you've just identified. You have to first make the diagnosis of myocardial infarction before you know to give a beta blocker as opposed to the questions that I've asked, what's the side effect of a beta blocker? That may still be asked but in a very different way. This of course is our Q bank. Now, to talk about it a little bit in a moment how we intend you to need to use the Qbank. Lots of people use Qbanks just to study from and of course we have the next lesson which is how to do questions and then there are flash cards and flash cards you have to be very careful about. Flash cards is available in the Flashback app as well on the dashboard in the flash cards. Flash cards are useful if they're used as a memory tool like the review book. Test writers want you to have free word association. Wheezing-asthma and they're going to give you a question about wheezing and asthma is going to be a choice but it has nothing to do with asthma. If you just loosely learn and rather than getting the entire illness script that is the patient presentation, diagnosis and treatment and you don't know a little bit about it, all you know is some loose word association that are going to trap you with distracters as we'll talk about in the questions section. So flash cards are useful, but only when used in conjunction with other resources that help solidify the information you're learning rather than try to teach it to you from the start and there's some other things I didn't put up here that is like journal articles, primary literature, academics hate that I say this and I am an academic myself but I really don't think that you should be reading reference books or primary literature, it's not worth it. You have to first learn that the person who has a crushing substernal chest pain has an MI and that everyone with coronary artery disease needs beta blockers [indiscernible] before you start reading about primary literature in the most up and coming stuff. Right? In medical school you must learn the classic illness script, black-white, yes-no. So these are the different options you have and you've probably figured this out from your own university or your own searching on forums, you must have a review book and you must have questions. It doesn't matter which book you pick as long as you have one of the main review sources and the Qbank that is learn the material you absolutely must identify on the test and practice for the test, okay. At OnlineMedEd we've created our learning paradigm called PACE. Which stands for prime, acquire, challenge and enforce and we go into more detail on this on that last lecture in educational theory. The idea is that you do P, A, and C at once and then you use E when it's right. Let's talk about it in just a second. For prime, what we want you to do is read the notes and then in that scene session after you finish reading the notes, taking down your own notes in the quick tables, you then watch the video. You just read the same material and now you get it again audiovisual and of course we keep our lessons short because that's how adult learners learn. But then we want you to take that information you just learned and force you into a new uncomfortable situation where you actually have to use it. That is the challenge portion where you use the Qbank. Now, you don't have to follow PACE rigidly. If you do, you'll have success but not everyone's going to want to do all the pieces and sometimes you'll want to save the questions for later on when you're preparing for the test not necessarily at the same time. You can use these resources however you want but our learning paradigm is set up to maximize understanding and retention. We do that by delivering it in multiple modalities, repeating that same information in different ways challenging you a little bit and then when it's the right time to use the quick tables and the Flashback app to cue up key things in memory. Forty-eight hours after you watch a video your flash cards become active because at 48 hours is what the maximum time to reengage that memory to solidify it and you get extra repeats of the must-know information to the quick tables, alright. These are the resources you have to choose from. Do you have to use all of them? No. Do you have to use any one? Probably not, but I would definitely get that review book and the Qbank but then as we're going to talk about you may have to set your own goals, how long you have and what do you want to score and what's your baseline but when you choose a study schedule or when you choose a study system, I want you to know what you're picking and why knowing the limitations of each of the different things that are available and most importantly stay away from primary literature and reference books. They're too much to study for where you're at. That is Education Resources. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Our Educational Theory]  
﻿This final lesson on Educational Theory will probably serve no practical purpose for most students who come to the site. It's only here for you to under it out with me if you're interested in medical education or you want to know why we've chosen to do what we do. So I want to start off with the VARK organizer for the different learning styles and move through how to maximize skills and then mitigate skills decline and finish off with Bloom's taxonomy. I'm going to use a little bit of a lingo that's involved in the education theory but I'm going to show you more how it's practically used by us and I'm not going to go deep into some weird pathophysiology of education. But let's start off with the different types of learning models and a pretty well-established model is VARK, which attempts to codify the different types of learners that there are. VARK stands for Visual, Aural or Audio, R is Read-write, and K is Kinesthetic. Now, Kinesthetic doesn't necessarily map very well into an online curriculum. Kinesthetics are going to be those people who like to use the little robot arms to tie a suture but you can see that already likely how we've taken this version of learning styles and ensured that PACE includes something for everyone. Now, people say, oh, I'm not a visual learner, I mean, that's garbage, of course you are, 10% percent of your brain is dedicated to vision, you're a visual learner unless your blind. Right? But what they say is, oh, I'm not a visual learner, I hate lecture, is that that person is probably Read-write predominant. No one is just one but people have different ways of learning and the idea is that we created PACE, we've created OnlineMedEd to satisfy all potential learning styles. So if you don't like PACE but you love the notes and the videos, you can use the notes and videos, it still works, but we've created it in a way that uses audio visual in the way of the videos. Visual Read-write in the way of the notes and note taking as well as Kinesthetic in the way of the questions and the Qbank. In addition, we've also stuck with what we know about adult learner behavior. You'll notice that with some rare exceptions all the videos are less than 20 minutes. This is because that is the average time an adult learner can attend something. Even better when their speed is accelerated to 1.5 or 2X, it feels faster. What you'll notice, if you remember from phase one we said a pretty good student can probably tackle prime, acquire, challenge, in about an hour. The reason for that is its 20 minutes to read the notes, 20 minutes to watch the video and 20 minutes to do the questions and it might take a little longer for a slower learner but the point is, each section, each block is about 20 minutes which is the maximum time an adult learner can to pay attention, unlike the 55-minute long PowerPoint lectures that you probably did in the basic sciences and it also affords an opportunity to break. This is the other thing that we know about adult learners, they can't sit in a classroom for four hours. It doesn't work. No one pays attention and so, at the end of reading your notes you can go cook dinner or make out with your wife or pet your cat or whatever and like you can do whatever you want and come back to the lesson, you don't have to sit there for an hour, you can do it in 20-minute blocks. So we've taken all the different learning styles that someone has and purposefully used, what we know about adult learning behavior to generate PACE. The benefit of this is to maximize skills and then to mitigate skills decline. Let's first talk about maximizing skills. Maximizing skills in this point is basically medical knowledge and a little bit of your ability to take multiple choice questions. I mean that's not really what I wanted to do but it's a byproduct of preparing you for STEP and actually this is not a STEM prep program but this is the foundations for the rest of your life as you'll see we use advanced education principles like blocking and also advanced organizers to help you understand and retain the information, really I'm getting ahead of myself. When you walk in to clinicals you effectively start here and you can still be successful on your own. Right? You know probably your own learning style even if someone hasn't codified for you and so you get to work and you begin to learn. Now, never will you be as knowledgeable and as proficient as you are at the end of residency, medical school, ah, but the point is as you begin to learn you're going to peak and afterwards you're probably just going to decline because you start taking short cuts and you don't keep up the literature, it's okay, you're still doing good, it's just the natural course of learning. So ideally, you'd want to find a resource that takes your slope like this, so that at the same time point, you have learned more and done better. The way we do that is by using repetition, multiple modalities, mapping VARK to prime, acquire, challenge and enforce, notes, videos questions, quick tables, flashcards and it is a blended and integrated approach. Right? These are not elements that have been created separate from each other by different people and we just thrown together and say okay that's the course. No, the people who make the notes, make the videos, make the Qbank, make the quick tables. Yeah, it's me in front of the camera but there are guys behind the scenes making it so everything fits together but this has an extra side effect that is it mitigates skills decline. Let's say we've chosen to do the right thing and learned a lot. Right? So now the person who started at nothing finishes their training having done really well. Now ideally what would happen is you just learn everything and it stays just as good. Getting back to our swimmer, if someone takes a couple of years off from swimming they're probably never going to be a national competitive swimmer again because what ends up happening as you take shortcuts and start to practice and life gets dragged and you don't keep up, what happens is you plummet and that's the natural way things go. Now, you know the phrase, it's like riding a bicycle. If you just ride a little bit more the skills come back, you may not be that you know that competitive athlete that you used to be, but alright but then as you begin to not use the bike anymore you decline and then you start to use it again, okay and so this is what we've unintentionally done by using things like advanced organizers. The color codes, the algorithms, the pictures or the mnemonics, those are a way of creating foundations, the illness script within a disease is set. So that every time you engage chest pain, if you see the little guy with his arms up and the intern book with a guy holding the rifle, this is in the next level topics for medicine. If you see that every time, every time you think about someone with chest pain it's not just do they have coronary artery disease or not it's you're seeing the method and so, you're re-engaging close to where you want to be advanced organizers blocking the material building the foundation allows you to have something to add on as you go through residency you realize truth is actually more important than understanding. Right? You have to know all there is to know about the thing that you're specializing in but in the beginning understanding was more important than truth so you have a baseline. Now, the things you're not going to specialize in it, you're not going to make more robust illness scripts but if you have this framework to attach on details to it's easier to hold on to that information and reengage it. So because we've had you do repetition of alternate modalities and because we use advanced organizers this is really is the foundations for the rest of your life and you go through residency to get the experiential learning to get the details but it's always mapped back on to what we do here and lastly, is Bloom's taxonomy. This is definitely the most nerd alert. Bloom's taxonomy as I see it is a way of maturing someone's ability and I'll break it down into three. There's more than this, but this is how you can simply understand it and the most basic form at the bottom of the pyramid is facts and memorization. Right? What is the dose of metoprolol, 25 milligrams of BID? Simple rote memorization but then you begin to be able to analyze, so you see a case, a person, the history, that forces you to use facts and memorization in a new way to put those things together rather than just regurgitate and ultimately you pass on to synthesis, where you generate new concepts and new ideas on your own without even having to be given a case to begin with. See how this works with OnlineMedEd, at the MS, three, four years, yeah, you have to learn the facts. Understanding is more important than truth, black and white, no curveballs. This is where you're going to see most of PACE. You're going to see prime, acquire and enforce. The quick tables and the flashbacks are literally just rote memorization but then you can start doing challenge here at the analysis phase. The Qbanks are designed to be done after you've read the notes and watch the videos because they want you to get facts and memorization as first and then challenge yourself by doing a clinical vignette that forces you into a situation which you may not have the answer and ultimately, once you get into residency, we have things like clinical cases and the next level content where you make your illness scripts more robust and you actually see real live people who have real live ambiguity that had real live questions come up now on rounds and so, you get to have that experience without actually seeing the person but it takes you, it takes you up the chain to getting into a complete independence and maintaining your skills. This is a little bit on Educational Theory, you're probably not going to get any practical use out of this, so thank you for those of you who watched. Just know that we at OnlineMedEd have used Educational Theory and research to construct our model, we didn't just make it up and it does two things, it gets you learning more faster and also creates a system where you can hang on to that knowledge as you go through life and we've done it based on Educational Theory that exists not just haphazardly thrown in together. That Educational Theory. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Schedules and Expectations]  
﻿What I want to talk about in this lesson is the schedules that you can create using OnlineMedEd content and so far we've talked about how to do questions, the different review materials there are in order to prepare studying the different phases of learning and now I want to get into the practical aspects of how do you actually get it all done? I want to remind you that we've created this integrated blended model where you get different modalities to teaching you the same content that helps it stick and enhances understanding and retention. It's a little extra work reading and watching and doing questions, writing notes but we do it in a way that's purposefully integrated so that it actually becomes more efficient and more effective. The way we expect you to use this course is in the one year plan and I don't mean you're going to be studying for Step two for a year. What I mean is, you're going to be in phase one, the learning phase for most of the year and the idea is you're going to study block by block. The benefit to this method is that you do one lesson per day. It's about one hour for a fast student with a good foundation about two hours for a slower student, so plan accordingly but what you're going to do is PACE. Back to back to back you're going to prime by reading the notes, you're going to acquire by watching the videos and you're going to challenge doing the QBank and eventually at time repetitions you're going to enforce with quick tables and flashcards and in our block it's really easy, right, because you're only going to be studying that subject. I don't want you reading obstetrics when you're doing medicine. So, in obstetrics, you're going to read only the OB-GYN section of the quick tables. So, during the week, you are going to PACE one lesson per day. There's only 225 lessons total, working some time for vacation there and winter or summer recess and you've got about one lesson per day for the entirety of through third year or your clinical clerkships, you come out on the other end having trained up really well and then all you need to do is Taper a little bit and you crush the test. The problem is though that in this block by block method, the duration of the block is going to vary. Some rotations are only four weeks and that's usually things like neuro and psych. Some people have eight week rotations crammed into six weeks and that gets people into trouble because there may not be enough time to do every lesson in the major topic. Most rotations for the cores are eight weeks, things like IM, surgery, Peds and OB-GYN. Now for those people who are fortunate enough to have 12 week core rotations. You're probably going to have no trouble in getting all your lessons done within the block. What I want you to feel is, you're going to be in phase one learning, prime, acquire, challenge and enforce, one lesson per day and of course you're not going to remember everything from the beginning of the year but it's really easy to come out of that, watch something at 2X or blow through your notes real quick and all of a sudden and all comes rushing back because you solidified it so well but in general if you're trying to plan your block what you want to look at is the longer duration blocks. The goal would be to repeat lessons, do the full prime, acquire, challenge and enforce multiple times and include a Taper phase for yourshelf. For example, we've only got 25 topics in pediatrics, if you're on a 12 repeat pediatric rotation, you're going to get through a lesson three times, one lesson per day and that's okay because some other times you're going to like enter medicine where you realize you're going to push it. By the way these schedules are available in your shelf and Step guide on your resource tab in your dashboard. On the contrary, for shorter blocks you're going to be grinding. You may not get through everything, you're only going to be doing each lesson once and this is where it's really important to rest the day before the test, like actually take a break because you're going to be running into the test day having grinding the entire time. So you're going to be able to pick which version you've got and we have some things to help you out but the yearlong plan is the way we intend on you doing it so that you don't feel overburdened but some people come to us when they're already done with clerkships, they haven't heard of us or they didn't use us and they're like, "Hey, I still want to use your curriculum, what can I do to study for Step?" Now if you're intending on using the phases of learning, phase one, phase two, you're going to use PACE and then Taper, people ask me, "How can I do it in four weeks, is that enough time?" No, it's not. If you're only going to spend four weeks, you need to set realistic goals. So, the first thing you want to do if you're coming to us for the first time fresh for step two only is set goals. What I'm talking about is the difference between pass and perform. Fundamentally, what this means is in the pass category what you want to do is get all the same questions right that everyone else is going to get right. To do that, you don't need us, there are plenty of resources that get that done, we're happy to have you, what I want you to feel is that we are more designed for the long haul, the long-term success. To do a pass, really you can do this in less than four weeks and what I recommend you do is go and get a review book and a QBank. You get through that review book once or twice in a month, you do all the questions in a learning manner, take the test but the thing is, that if you really want to perform, if you really want to learn the medicine and have that stick, we'll talk more about this in the educational theory video that follows, you're going to want to try to get a 250 plus you're going to need augmentation. To do augmentation, you have to put in that extra effort and to put in an extra effort realistically, I think you're going to need more than four weeks, this is PACE and then it transitions into a Taper phase. This is doing it the way we intended it only you're accelerating it by doing a whole bunch of lessons per day. So, if you're talking about performance, augmentation, what you're really referring to is you're going to get all the core information, no problem, right? That's going to come up over and over and over again and you can be reasonably sure if it ends up in a review book or in a QBank you're probably going to see it but for augmentation, you're going to have to learn five to six things you're not going to see on the test in order to get one extra point. You need to be honest with yourself. Are you able to keep up with the grueling pace? Are you able to put in eight, twelve hours per day and are you able to do that for an extended period of time? If the answer is no, I still got by Sub-I going on, I want to prepare for Step 2 during my Sub-I. You're just not going to make that, the time to do what you need to do, so keep it simple. But if what you care about is getting the 250 or more, you're willing to put in the time and the effort, well, there's just two different ways you can do this. For Step-Prep, there is the eight week grueling pace where you're going to work 10 to 12 hours per day and you're going to do it six to seven days per week and your goal is to get in six to eight lessons per day. It's going to take you about six weeks. That schedule is printed out for you versus the slightly less grueling version which is going to be the 12 week plan where you're only going to put in eight hours a day and your goal is to get four lessons. Now even when I do remediation and I use this plan within internal medicine no student takes eight hours to do four lessons. They come in and get our early which is fine but they're blocking off enough time to get it done but also not burnout and the idea here, you'll go a little slower have a little bit more breathing room but it takes longer to get through versus the grueling pace. Now we have these resources on your dashboard to help you plan your study strategy but I want to reiterate the best way to use OnlineMedEd is in the phase one learning using it through all your clerkships, learning and consolidating all of that information and then when you come out on the other side having already done it, you just blow through the videos at 2X, Taper through a QBank, get a 250 but if you're willing to put any effort and the time to come do it in a dedicated study period, we're here for you as well. That is Education Schedules. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - The Phases of Learning]  
﻿In this lesson, what I want to talk about are the Phases of Learning. Now, see how that correlates with actually constructing a schedule, whether we're doing it yearlong, three month or two month plan for a shelf or STEP prep, that's the next lesson that follows, in this one, I want to talk about the Phases of Learning and I actually want to actuate it to an athlete. It make sense that a boxer in order to be a competitive challenger would have to be more than the sum of his parts, that is to say once he gets into the ring on the big fight day he's going to need to have done strength training, so that when he hits, he hits hard, he's going to have done speed training and agility training so that when he moves or tries to block, he can, he's also going to need to have done endurance, running bleachers and skipping rope in order to keep up the stamina to go 10 rounds but all the while who also need to have sparred in order to keep up his skills as a boxer. In the same sense, that training, that high intensity, multiple modality training that's effective for athletes can be effective for you when it comes to game day, that is the test, so, we'll talk about phase one which is actuating to modalities, to building a well-rounded athlete but then very much like a swimmer who may train every stroke to practice as a day two hours of practice during the on-season, as the big meet comes up the Taper, the Taper is designed not to lose anything but you're not trying to make any gains either, the idea being during that prep phase, that intense phase, you got to that as competitive of an athlete as you're going to get, and the Taper makes sure you maintain without burning out, both also without losing anything and then the night before, you don't do anything, it sucks to walk into the ring with a pulled muscle, so you take it easy, three phases of being an athlete, three Phases of Learning. Phase one is called the learning phase, this is equivalent to training and the idea is and to be a well-rounded athlete you have to attack the body from multiple modalities, the same is true of challenging your brain to be the ultimate test taking machine, this is effectively PACE, prime, acquire, challenge, and then enforce. That is for each topic as you're going through phase one of learning, you are intended, this is why the pages are set up this way to read the notes, prime your brain to the key issues then immediately the following the notes watch the videos, all the while taking notes into your quick tables in the margins, things you missed or things you didn't understand or some light bulb that went off that may not have gone off before and after you've done the notes and videos in the same session you're supposed to do the Qbank questions that go along with that lesson. The idea is that we are hitting the weight room speed and agility of the boxer correlated to multiple modalities. Now this sounds like a lot of work and you may be surprised to find that doing the same content in multiple modalities is a lot of work but we've done it in a way that is effective and efficient, for an advanced student, someone who has a really good foundation already and has done well on previous multiple choice exams it takes about an hour to get through prime acquired challenge, 20 minutes to read, 20 minutes to watch, 20 minutes to do the questions, for the average student it takes about two hours a day. Now when someone says, man I got to student two hours per day on top of my 12 hours shifts, now you've got the quick tables to bring with you, but yeah, that's the idea by doing it, by using multiple modalities, by repeating the same information but in different ways, you promote understanding and retention, you might get it a little different in one modality to another and in doing so, it clarify topics and the repetition makes it stick, then at specific intervals you're going to engage the enforce. Which is the quick tables and the flash cards, we have it set up so that 48 hours after you do a lesson the flash cards become active for that lesson, 48 hours is the designated time by research that says that's the time to re-engage this stuff you've learned in order to solidify it. During the week you're going to go lesson by lesson, notes, videos, Qbank, flash cards 48 hours later and on the weekends you're going to hit the quick tables, it is a lot of work becoming a competitive athlete but with the materials we give you in a course that's designed to be blended, you're going to get purposeful re-enforcement, it's not haphazard, it's designed this way which makes your studying very effective and time efficient. This is going to be the majority of your study, phase one learning and much like that swimmer, as they prepare for the big meet they enter phase two, phase two is simulation. This is the Taper, the idea here is that sense you've learned everything in the learning phase, you're not going to learn anything new, in fact if you try you're probably just going to lose something else in the way that the swimmer might try to grow before a big meet, he's not going to be a 100% come swim day. So, as you prepare for the test you want to simulate exactly what it's going to be like without trying to learn new things, to do that, you're going to do the day, every day the same way during the Taper. You are going to go to sleep at the same time as you were going to do on testing, you're going to wake up at exactly the same time, you're going to eat the same thing at the same time every day and you're going to feel what it's like to do seven blocks of 44 questions, you are going to do a simulation of the actual test. You want to feel what it's like after two straight blocks, do you need to take 10 minutes every block or can you take 40 minutes after two, when are you going to eat lunch, how much are you going to eat, what's it like if you have a bottle of water extra, you're not trying to learn any new information, you're just practicing with what you got, you're maintaining through the Taper phase and then phase three which people have a lot of trouble with is the rest phase. The day before your test, you should do nothing, you shouldn't study anything else, you shouldn't look at anything, it's all in there. You know you've been using the reinforcement techniques that promotes retention and understanding, you've Tapered through you're ready for the test, you know what it feels like, you know what it looks like, now is the time to chill out, you don't want to pull a muscle before getting in the ring, you also don't want to come in hung over, so don't take it too easy but the idea is try to do nothing and most people can't do nothing, so that rest day is a great day to go through those things that are going to be cramped, things like pediatric milestones or rheumatology, serology the diagnosis, the stuff that just doesn't stick, that's a good time to review those things. And so your study period, no matter how long it is and we'll talk more about that in the next section is going to consist of weeks of studying, you see at the end of Saturday and Sunday, the weekends and the Monday through Friday, Monday through Friday you're going to do the lessons and the lessons are going to be PACE. You get up in the morning you do the flash cards, from the videos two days ago and then you go through the lesson, prime, acquire, challenge one at a time, you're going to do that Monday to Friday. On the weekends, the goal is to read the quick tables. If you're fast you'll get through the whole thing in a weekend, if you're not that fast, you just keep reading from where you left off until the whole thing is read and you cycle through again, the idea is that you're ready, not just the quick tables but the notes you've added. As you approach test day things should get easier, this is test day, the day before test day is rest day and up to that point you've been Tapering, after test day, party or whatever. So, I want you to see, now this might be a little high level and the comparison to athletes may not make sense to everybody but I want you to see that we have designed OnlineMedEds with particularly to do the learning phase, that is the solidify the knowledge in a way that you're not going to forget it, you've learned it well, you've learned it correctly and you're going to remember. We also know that you need the prep for the test to actually train for the exam, not during the Taper phase, you're not going to learn anything new and you make sure you rest one day before, so no matter whether you're planning for a shelf which usually doesn't have much of a Taper phase or for the STEP exam, you can choose your schedule based on how grueling you want to make it and how long you want it to take. That is Education Phases of Learning.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Bias]  
﻿This video is about bias. Bias is anything that affects the outcome of your study that is not what you're to test. There are tons of sources of bias. I'm just going to cover the ones that come up on tests most frequently. If you want a more comprehensive list, take a look at the notes. All right. Let's break this down, based on some sources of bias. Research subjects or study participants are one source. Researchers themselves are another sources, and then there are some biases that are just inherent in doing research, these we'll say come from the study. All right. Bias that comes from subjects. First one that you need to know is Hawthorne effect. Now, in Hawthorne effect people change their behavior because they know that they're being observed. So, observation leads to behavior change. The next one that you need to know is a recall bias. In recall bias, the way that I want you to remember this is that sick patients remember more. So, this happens in retrospective studies, where you have a group of sick patients and a group of healthy people, and you ask them to think back to exposures in their past, and people who are sick are going to think just a little bit harder about exposures that they might have had, out of an eagerness to explain their illness. And the way that you address bias that comes from subjects is with blinding, that's where you don't let them know what group they've been assigned to, and when only the subjects are blinded that is referred to as single blinding. All right. So, biased that comes from the researcher, is a much bigger deal, but fortunately it is also easier to address. The first one here that you need to know about is selection bias. In that selection bias, at baseline the groups that you're comparing are different from each other in a way that they shouldn't be. So for example, if I'm a researcher and I put all of my sickest patients into the group receiving the study drug and all of my healthier patients into the group receiving the placebo. I can't really make a fair comparison at the end of the trial. So that selection bias. You can think of it as, groups are different at baseline, and the way that you address this is with randomization, that is you don't let the researcher pick who goes into what group. You do a coin flip or a random number generator, so that it's based on just random chance, not based on what I want as the researcher. You can't always do randomization, and another tool that you can use to address that is matching. So that's where for every person in the study group you get somebody who is similar to them, who matches them in terms of demographics, and you group them for the comparison group, and the way that you show that you're matching and your randomizations have been successful, is you show that they have similar demographics, and you compare these in a table. All right. Next one you need to know about is observer bias. In observer bias, the researcher knows what group everyone has been assigned to. They know who is getting the placebo and who is getting the study drug, and their knowledge of this impacts the way that they evaluate everybody, consciously or unconsciously. So researcher evaluates, differently, and the way that you address this is you don't let them know what group people are in. You blind them and when both the researcher and the subject have been blinded, this is double blinding. All right. So let's move on to sources of bias that come from just doing research itself. Next one I want to talk about is confounding. Confounding is the most important topic in this whole video, if you learn nothing else, learn confounding. All right. So, what confounding is, is when you have an exposure, and you have some outcome and you see that they are related, so you think, hey, the exposure must be causing the outcome, but you are wrong, because there is a third factor that you did not think about, that is related to both the exposure and to the outcome, and that third factor is distorting the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Let's talk through an example. Bizarrely enough, ice cream consumption is associated with an increase in drowning deaths. So, I might be tempted to say, hey, ice cream consumption causes drowning, but I'm wrong, because I did think about summer. Summer causes ice cream consumption. Summer also causes drowning deaths, and when I count for this fact, the relationship between the exposure and the outcome disappears. That's confounding. Ways that you address this, you can do -- you can do a good study design, or you can do randomization, you can do matching, either one works. Do not confuse this with effect modification. So, effect modification technically is not a bias. So, I'm going to put it in little parentheses here. We need to discuss it here though, because it gets confused with confounding so easily. Let me show you why. Just like with confounding, we have our exposure, and we have our outcomes, and we think that they're related, and there's even a third factor here, and the third factor is associated with the outcome. The difference here, is that the third factor is not related to the exposure, and this is key. The third factor enhances the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Let's talk through an example. Oral contraceptive pill, OCPs are associated with a small increase in the risk of DBTs. If you look a little bit closer, you see that it is not just the OCPs that is causing the increase in DBTs. It is oral contraceptive, OCPS, and smoking together that causes the big increase in DBTs. Smoking is not really related to OCPs, but when you add smoking to oral contraception, you have a modification, an enhancement of the effect, and that is the key difference here, when you add the third factor, you get a stronger effect. Okay. So, just to do a quick recap, when you have bias that comes from subjects, you want to blind. When you have bias that comes from the researcher, you want to blind again. Double blind. You also can use randomization and matching, and do not confuse, confounding and effect modification. Remember that in confounding, your third factor negates the relationship between your exposure and your outcome, and in effect modification, your third factor enhances the relationship, and that is bias.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Confidence Interval]  
﻿This video is about confidence intervals. If you haven't done this already, I highly recommend that you watch my video on hypothesis testing, and my video on risk before proceeding. Okay. So, let's talk about what happens when you do a study. When you do a study, you have population that you're hoping to make generalizations about. So, this is the whole population, and you collect data from a group of people, this is the sample, and from your sample you calculate a mean, and the mean that you calculate from your sample is a guess. You hope that it is representative of the rest of the greater population that you're trying to generalize about, but you can't be sure unless you give yourself some wiggle room, and the way that you do that is with a confidence interval. Confidence interval, makes you more likely to contain the actual population value that you are trying to make a guess at. Okay. So, now let's think back to the hypothesis testing video. Remember in the hypothesis testing video what we were trying to get at was significance. Was there a statistically significant group -- uh, difference between the two groups, and so the way that we did that, was we were comparing two means, and if our P value, which we calculated from our data, if our P value was less than alpha -- alpha the predetermined cut off for what is statically significant. P was less than alpha, we had reached significance, and if P was greater than alpha, we had not reached statistical significance. So, in order to make a more accurate comparison, the thing that we should do is incorporate our wiggle room. We need to include our confidence intervals. What that would look like, is say means plus wiggle room. So, comparing our two means with a 95 percent confidence interval is equivalent to using a cut off of alpha of .05. 95 percent confidence interval, the same thing, alpha .05. So, now instead of comparing P to alpha, what we're going to check is whether or not our two confidence intervals overlap. So, if we have a confidence interval that looks like this, and another one that looks like this, we have overlap, and when you're comparing two confidence intervals, overlap means that there's not a statistically significant difference between the two groups. You have overlap. So you have no statistical significance. Overlap is bad, it means that your groups are the same. If instead, your confidence intervals are really narrow, and you have no overlap, you have reached statistical significance, because there is no overlap between the two groups that means that your groups are different. All right. So, how do you get skinny narrow little confidence intervals? The way that you do that is with power. Increased power means narrower confidence intervals, it means you are more likely to reach statistical significance, and how do you get a higher power? You get a larger sample size. So you include more people in your study. All right. So, that is how you interpret a confidence interval when you are comparing two means. You get two confidence intervals and you don't want them to overlap. You are actually more likely to get tested on the interpretation of confidence intervals for odds ratios and relative risk, and remember from my odds ratio and relative risk video, that when you have an odds ratio or relative risk greater than one, that means that you have a positive association between your risk factor and your disease outcome, and if you have an odds ratio or relative risk that is equal to one, that means that there is no association, and if you have one that is less than one, that means that there is a negative association, and remember, this is for odds ratio, or relative risk. All right, and so for this, what you want to remember is that you do not want your confidence interval to cross one. So, this is one here, this is zero, it's two, and on, and on. Here's the line that we do not want the confidence interval to cross. So, if you have a confidence interval that is greater than one, and it doesn't include one at all, then you're in good shape. You still have an association between your risk factor and your outcome. If you have one, if you have a confidence interval that is less than one, but still doesn't cross one. Again, you're still in good shape, there still is an association between your risk factor and your outcome. If instead, you have a confidence interval that does cross one, you're in bad shape. There is no association between your risk factor and your outcome. Okay. So to recap, confidence interval, is just wiggle room to make sure that your guess includes the true population value, and when you're comparing two means, you do not want your confidence intervals to overlap one another if you're trying to show that you're groups are different, and in odds ratio and relative risk. You want to make sure that your confidence interval does not cross over one, if you're trying to show that there is a relationship between your risk factor and your outcome, and that is confidence intervals.

[Epidemiology and Stats - Diagnostic Tests]  
﻿Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value are measures of how good a diagnostic test is. There are also really frequently tested concepts, so you need to be comfortable calculating and interpreting them. Your best friend for this is a two by two table. Now, in a two by two table, disease status is always at the top, always. With positive on the left and negative on the right, and the test result will be on the side. Positive on top, negative on the bottom. All right. So, in the disease positive column, these people have the disease no matter what. Regardless, of what their test results says we know that they have the disease. So, if they have a positive test result, if that test is correct, that is a true positive test result. TP for true positive, and if they get a negative test result, that's not correct, that test is wrong, because we know that they have the disease. So this is a false negative. Similarly, for people who do not have the disease, that's the disease negative column. If they get a positive test result, even though they don't have the disease, the test is wrong. This is a false positive test result, and if they get a negative test, that test is correct, because they don't have the disease. So this is a true negative test result. All right. We are going to use these to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Let me just write these down. I'm going to write sensitivity down here at the bottom of the positive disease column. Specificity over here by negative diseases, positive test result gets positive predictive value, and negative test result gets negative predictive value, and when we calculate these four equations, what I want you to remember is that true is going to go on the top, and sum is going to go on the bottom. True on top, sum on the bottom. Let me show you -- let me show you what I mean. We'll start with sensitivity. Sensitivity, like I mentioned, is at the bottom of the positive disease column. So we're only looking at people who have the disease and within this column, true goes on top. So the true value here is true positive. That's going to be our numerator. True on top, true positive. Our denominator is the sum. Sum goes on the bottom. That's true positive and false negative. Sensitive tests frequently get used as screening tests. This is because they rarely miss the disease, and in fact, a test that is perfectly sensitive will never miss the disease. Unfortunately, sensitivity doesn't tell us anything about the rate of false positives, and also unfortunately, a lot of really sensitive tests have high rates of false positives. So, an example here would be Pap smears screening for cervical cancer, and if you have a positive Pap smear that means that cervical cancer is a possibility. That said, lots and lots of women have positive Pap smears and then when you do colposcopy, they end up not having cervical cancer. These are false positive test results. This is where specificity is helpful. So, specificity, remember, we are looking at the disease negative column. We're looking at people who do not have the disease, and remember again, true is going to go on the top, and the sum is going to go on the bottom, and so true within this column, is true negative, and our sum is true negative, plus false positive. Specific test frequently get used to confirm a diagnosis after you have a positive screening test, and this is because specific tests give very few false positives, and in fact, a test that is perfectly specific will never give a false positive. So, if a good example of a sensitive test is Pap smear, then a good example of a specific test would be colposcopy. So, to recap, sensitive tests are good because they don't miss the disease, and specific tests are good, because they don't give false positives. Now, there is a pneumonic that gets used frequently, that I find pretty confusing, but it gets used all the time. So, we're just going to go over it really quickly, that's spin and snout. So, let's start with snout. So for snout, you write SN for a sensitive test, SN -- SN, and then you write N again for negative. So given a highly sensitive test, if negative rules out the disease. So think again of the Pap smear, if you have a Pap smear that is negative, you can be pretty confident that you can rule out cervical cancer. Likewise -- likewise for spin, SP for specificity, you write another P for positive. So given a highly specific test, if it's positive rules in the disease. Thinking back to the colposcopy example, if you have a positive colposcopy, a positive specific test, you should probably be pretty concerned about cervical cancer. All right. Let's move on to positive predictive value. Positive predictive value is at the end of the test positive row. So we're only looking at people who have tested positive. Remembering, that true is going to go on top, the true value here is true positive, and the sum, is going to be true positive and false positive. So, how I like to think of positive predictive value, is it's what your patient is going to want to know if they get a positive test result. So, if I'm your patient, and I get a positive test result, if I show up in your office. I'm going to want to know given my positive test result, how likely is it that I actually have the disease, and another thing that you should know about positive predictive value. This is just one of those weird things that shows up on tests all the time for some reason. It's that with increasing disease prevalence. You get higher positive predictive value, and I just remember this because there are lots of Ps, all the Ps are going in the same direction. High prevalence, high positive predictive value. Okay. Let's move on to negative predictive value. Negative predictive value is here at the end of the negative test result row, and remember that true goes on the top, so our true within this row, it's true negative, and our denominator is the sum, false negative and true negative, and similar to what positive predictive value is, it's if you get a negative test result, you want to know how likely is that you actually are disease free. All right. Let's finish with the word on precision and accuracy. Precision in a diagnostic test requires that you are able to reproduce your results, and that your results are consistent. So, if I am an archer, and I go to the archery range, and I'm shooting at a bull's eye, and if all of my arrows kind of go pretty close together, around the same exact spot, really, really tight distribution, but none of them hit the bull's eye. I'm precise, but I'm not accurate. Precision, it does not require that your test measures what it intends to measure. It just measures that you can repeat it really, really consistently. However, with accuracy, your test needs to measure what it says that it's measuring. So, this would be, if I went to the archery range and I was getting a lot of arrows in the bull's eye, but not necessarily all in the bull's eye. In fact, they can be pretty spread out, and it will still be called accurate. As long as it's centered on the bull's eye, and I'm getting them in the bull's eye, that's considered accurate, it's just not precise, because I'm not reproducing my results really well. So, this is accurate. Now, ideally you have a test that is both precise and accurate, and that would look like this, where you get a nice tight distribution, all in the bull's eye. This is both precise and accurate. So, that's precision and accuracy. Let's just summarize really quickly the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. Just remember, that these are really important concepts, and you definitely need to be really comfortable of reproducing this table. Do not forget the disease status goes on top. Test result, goes on the side, and the positives, go in the top left corner. You should also remember, that sensitivity is going to be referring to people who have a disease, and specificity, is going to be referring to people who do not happen disease. Likewise, positive predictive value, refers to people who have a positive test result, and negative predictive value, refers to people who have a negative test result, and finally, when you are deriving all of these formulas, remember, true goes on the top, and the sum goes on the bottom, and that's it for diagnostic tests.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Hypothesis Testing]  
﻿This video is about hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is an important tool in medical research and it's also a fair game for your boards. So in medical research we're often trying to compare two groups. For example, say I want to study a new blood pressure medicine. One way that I could do this would be to get a group of people and give them the study drug and get another group of people and give them a placebo, and then compare the average blood pressure between the two groups. So the question that I'm asking is, is group one equal to group two or are they different? So these comparisons can be a little bit tricky, because sometimes groups are different just by luck of the draw, so just due to random chance I might pick a group of people for group one who has a lower average blood pressure than the people in group two. The question in statistics then becomes, if there is a difference between the two groups, is that just due to random chance? And so the way that we go about addressing this is with hypothesis testing. We're going to start with a hypothesis that most researchers secretly hope to be true, which is that group one does not equal group two. Researchers want this, because they usually want to show that there is a difference between the groups. They want to show that the people who got the study drug have a different outcome, have better blood pressure than the people who did not. So the way that we test this is with another statement that we hope to prove false, which is that group one equals group two. They are the same, they have the same outcome, and this is referred to as the null hypothesis, which is written with a big H and a little subscript zero. You can think of the zero as being for zero difference between the two groups, and this, the first statement, the one that researchers are usually secretly hoping for, this is the alternative hypothesis. This is what we want and this is what we test, and something that I want you to notice is that these two statements are mutually exclusive, that means if one of them is true the other one is false, they cannot both be true. Now that we have our null hypothesis, we need to decide whether or not we think that it's true. If we think that it is not true that is called rejecting the null hypothesis, and the way that we decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis is with something called a P value, and P value is calculated using our data. So we plug our data into some statistical software and outcomes the P value, and if the P value is small, that means that we get to reject the null hypothesis. We're betting that this is not true, we're betting that this is true, that there is a difference between the two groups. So when P is small we get to reject the null. If instead, P is large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We're stuck with it. We have to say that the groups are not different. So a smaller is better for P values, if you're trying to show that groups are different. So how do we decide what counts as small? The way that we do this is with something called Alpha, which is the significance level, and by convention and biomedical research this is set to 0. 5. This means that we are willing to accept up to a five percent chance that the difference between the two groups is due to chance alone. So we're willing to accept up to a five percent chance that the difference that we observed between the two groups is not due to the study drug, but actually due to just random chance. So alpha is the cutoff level where we decide whether P is small or large. If P is less than alpha if it is smaller than 0. 5 that means that we get to reject the null, and if P is greater than alpha, that means we failed to reject. So when P like I said is less than alpha, that means that we have reached statistical significance. This is what people are going for when they do research, and the way that this is denoted sometimes is with little stars, so we'll give this P a star. Researchers are always running around trying to get the smallest P possible. Remember that a smaller P is better if you're trying to show that there's a difference between groups, and if you're having a hard time getting that to stick in your head, remember that in statistics a small P makes a big difference. Okay. So -- so far we've been talking about rejecting the null or failing to reject the null based on our data. We calculate P and we compare it to the preset alpha and we're trying to make a decision. We're making a guess and this is a little bit weird to think about, but since we've been making a guess that means it's possible that were wrong. We could be guessing that the groups are the same when the reality is that they're different or vice versa, and if we're guessing wrong or making an error. There are two types of error that you need to know about, let's just talk about them with a table. On the top of our table, we'll talk about the truth about than null hypothesis. So the null hypothesis -- the null hypothesis can either be true or it can be false. This is the reality, this is what we don't necessarily know, this is what we're guessing at. So on the side, we're going to put our guess, and the guess that we make is based on our hypothesis testing. So if we do our hypothesis testing we get a large P, we fail to reject the null, and what that means is that we are guessing that the null is true, T for True, and if we get instead a small P and we reject the null hypothesis, what we are doing is we are guessing that the null is false. Okay. So let's start in the universe where the null hypothesis is in reality true. Regardless of what our data actually tell us. The null hypothesis is true. There actually is no difference between them. If we use our data to guess that the knoll is true, we're correct, we made the right decision. If instead we guess that the null hypothesis is false, still in the universe where the null hypothesis is in reality true, we've made an error. This is called Type 1 Error. Type 1 Error is rejecting the null hypothesis even though it's true. The probability of committing this type of error is equal to alpha. It's actually the same alpha that's here. So if this is alpha, the probability of this is one minus the alpha. All right. Let's move on to the universe where regardless of what our data end up telling us, the null hypothesis is false. There actually is a difference between the two groups. If within this universe where the null hypothesis false. We make a guess that the null hypothesis is true. We have again committed error. We've committed a Type 2 Error, and the probability of committing a Type 2 Error is equal to beta. All right, and if in this reality where the null hypothesis is false, we guess that the null hypothesis is false, we're correct again, and that this is equal to one minus beta, and this actually has a name. This one minus beta or the probability of guessing that the null is false, when it actually is false, and this is referred to as statistical power. Power is a good thing, we want it to be high. It's actually an indicator of the likelihood that we're going to make the right decision here. So the thing that I want you to remember about power is that it increases with larger sample sizes. So a bigger study with more people means greater statistical power. All right. So to recap, hypothesis testing is how we decide whether or not two groups are different and we do that by comparing a P value which we calculate from our data to alpha. If P is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis, and if it is larger than alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If we reject -- if we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true, we have committed a Type 1 Error and if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, when it was actually false we have committed a Type 2 Error, and finally power increases with increasing sample size, and that is hypothesis testing.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Prevention]  
﻿When you think of prevention, what you usually think of is never getting the disease in the first place, but actually it's a little bit more convoluted than that, and I want to go over some vocabulary, and then solidify it so that you know what type of intervention is what type of prevention. You'll see what I mean in a minute. There's three degrees of prevention, primary prevention is what you think of as the lay term of prevention, that is you prevent the onset of disease. We're going to use an example of hypertension here through this and then we'll get into more details at the end. The idea here, is that a normal patient may progress to having hypertension. Primary prevention, would intervene to keep the person normal. That is they never develop hypertension in the first place. Secondary prevention, is all about detection. They have the disease, what you want to do is delay progression. That is the person who has hypertension will be prevented from developing the sequela of myocardial infarction. Tertiary prevention, is not prevention at all. This is preventing the complications that arise of that's a sequela. In this case, the myocardial infarction would lead to CHF. Now, it can become a little convoluted, about which one is which, but there are some things that come up a lot, that are going to then help you label which one it is, and if you just memorize it and try to figure it out. You can get some points on the test. In life, you're just going to do these things, it doesn't matter what you call them you're going to do them all, but as it comes the testing you might find yourself caught trying to pick primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary prevention is what you want to do. Primary prevention is all about reducing exposure. You know a certain exposures cause diseases, we generally call them risk factors. The goal here is to reduce exposure in the first place. Examples of primary prevention are going to be things like, weight loss, smoking cessation, reduce alcohol intake, and eating better. Now, eating better isn't meant to be intentionally vague, because this is a touchy subject, but of course, more leafy greens, more vegetables, more organic stuff better than fast food and processed foods. Primary prevention may also be in the form of a therapy though. Right, so primary prevention may include vaccination. The idea is, that we either prevent any problem from coming if they get exposed or we reduce the exposure overall. Secondary prevention, is more about screening and early intervention. Screening and intervention is going to be achieved with screening tests, and to be a good screening test, you generally want to be sensitive. That is will tolerate false positives, so that we don't miss false negatives, and when we identify a disease early, we intervene generally in the form of lifestyle modifications, of course, but often medications. To use a concrete example, diabetics who are diagnosed with an A1C of 7.1 are put on oral medications and asked to exercise. Their A1C may fall to non-diabetic levels. You got a diabetic diagnosed with an A1C of 14, and you need to put them on multi-daily injections of subcutaneous insulin. They're likely to get worse. So secondary prevention is about finding disease early through screening tests, and intervening before they become a problem. Tertiary prevention is about treatment of disease. This is going to be achieved through lifestyle modifications, but usually that is not enough. So tertiary prevention is almost never a lifestyle, at this point it is going to be through treatments, and is generally considered more responsive than preventive, and here I'm talking about neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Aspirins, statin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor for coronary artery disease, after the stents been placed with clopidogrel. Tertiary prevention, is what you do when you treat disease. Secondary prevention is figuring out that they have it in the first place and trying to get rid of it. Primary prevention, is reducing the exposure so they never develop it in the first place, and to get on my soapbox a little bit here, primary prevention costs very little. It's usually just talking to somebody doesn't involve anything, except maybe a vaccine. Secondary prevention costs a little bit more, that screening colonoscopy or the fact that you end up treating someone with stage one hypertension, but the big deal is tertiary prevention active therapy is the most costly. Chemotherapy for drugs, frequent bouts to the hospital. The idea being that, those who are in tertiary prevention are the ones we're going to cost the most, and the reason in our country, that 99% of our healthcare dollars goes towards one percent of the population, is because that one percent is here. They have severe disease, they're barely hanging on, and we're giving all the therapy we can to keep them alive. Whereas, those people who were healthy and stay healthy don't cost anything. That's prevention. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Risk]  
﻿This video is about risk. Risk is a measure of incidence of disease. We're going to be focusing on odds ratio and relative risk, which explore the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and development of a disease. The first thing that we need to do though is talk about probability versus odds. Those terms get used interchangeably in everyday life, but they actually mean something slightly different. Let's talk through an example. One out of every 10 people in the US is left-handed. So if we want to calculate the probability of being left-handed, the way that we do that is by comparing the number of events to events plus non-events, and what we mean here by events is the number of people who have the thing that we're interested in. The number of left-handed people and if it's one out of every 10 people the number of events then would be one, there's one event, and then the number of events again would be one and then the number of non-events would be the number of people who are right-handed. So it'd be nine. So probability of being left-handed is one for events, over one for events, plus nine for none-vents, compare that to odds. To calculate the odds of being left-handed, I would compare the number of events to the number of non-events. So one for events, because there's one left-handed person, and then nine for non-events, because they're nine right handed people. Something that you should know about probability and odds is that they approximate one another when you are looking at a rare disease, and that is because the number of healthy people or the number of non-events is really high, so these numbers would both be high, but the number of events, the number of people who have the disease, this would be really low. So basically you end up looking at just the number of events to the number of non-events when this number is really small. So let me repeat, odds and probability approximate each other with rare diseases. Okay. So that's the difference between probability and odds. I know they're really similar, but they're going to be used differently in odds ratios and relative risk. Let's start by using a table to understand the difference between odds ratio and relative risk. So, we're going to do a two by two table that's going to look pretty familiar. There will be disease status on top whether or not somebody has the disease with positive in the top left corner and negative on the right, and on the side will be exposure status, whether or not somebody has been exposed to a disease. Positive on the top, negative on the bottom. If this looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen something really similar when looking at sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, and so far they are identical except for exposure status is on the side whereas in the other one, the test result is on the side. All right. Now to fill these in, you have A and B, and the disease or in the exposure positive row. A and B in the first row, C and D in the exposure negative row, in the row people who have not been exposed, A, B, C, D. Remember to always put this table together the same way with disease status on top, exposure on the side, A and B in the first row, and C and D in the second row. Okay. So let's use these to talk about odds ratio and relative risk, finally. So when you do a cohort study, what you do is you get a group of people who have been exposed to a risk factor, you get another group of people who have not been exposed to a risk factor, and you follow them over time to see who develops the disease, and in order to make that comparison you use something called relative risk, which I'm going to abbreviate RR. So relative risk gets used for cohort studies. So what this is looking at is the probability of getting the disease in people who have been exposed over the probability of disease in people who have not been exposed, and we're using probability here, so we're going to be using events over events plus non-events to calculate what goes next. So, let's start with the numerator here. We need to find the probability of disease in people who have been exposed. So we're only looking at people who have been exposed, we're only going to be looking at A and B because this is the population of people who have been exposed. So we need to find what are the events and one of the non-events here. So the events would be who has the disease. So A is the events. A over everybody who's been exposed, A and B, events and non-events. A plus B. So just to repeat the probability of people of getting the disease in people who have been exposed is A over A plus B. Now we're going to look at the probability of disease in people who have not been exposed, so we're only looking at C and D. This row of people who have not been exposed, and we're going to find that the number -- we're going to find the events, and the events here again is the people who have the disease, so it's going to be C, and then that means that the non-events is D. So it'll be C over C plus D. This is relative risk. Compare that to odds ratios, which I'll abbreviate OR, which are used for case control studies. In a case control study, you start with a group of people who have the disease that you're interested in, and then you also get a group of people who are -- who do not have the disease that you're interested in and you look back and you ask them, were you exposed to this risk factor? And then you compare between the two, and like I said the way that you make this comparison is with odds ratio. So the way that you calculate odds ratio is unsurprisingly using odds rather than probability. So you find the odds of a positive exposure in people who have the disease over the odds of having the exposure and people who do not have the disease. All right, and so what is -- how do we calculate the odds of exposure in people who have the disease. We need to look first at people who have the disease, so we're going to be looking at this column, and here we need to again find what is the event and what is the non-event, but we want to know who was exposed. So positive exposure is our event and negative exposure is our non-event. So the odds of exposure and people who have the disease would be A over C that is our numerator A over C. Events over non-events, and then the odds that exposure in people who do not have the disease, we need to look in the disease negative column, and that's B and D, and so which one is the event here? The event here again would be positive exposure, because that's what we're interested in. So it would be B for events over D for non-events. B over D. We have A over C, over B over D, and then this simplifies to A, D, over B, C. That's odds ratio. Okay. So let's talk about how you interpret these. The interpretation for odds ratio and relative risk for our purposes is essentially the same. You're trying to figure out what is the relationship between the exposure and the disease. Does the disease come from being exposed? So if you have an odds ratio or relative risk that is greater than one, what that means is there's a positive association between being exposed to something and getting the disease. So there's a positive association. An example might be smoking as your exposure and COPD as your disease status. People who smoke are more likely to get the COPD. If your odds ratio or your relative risk is equal to one that means that there is no association between exposure, and the outcome, and the exposure and the disease. So, an example if we still are using smoking would be, smoking and say getting a bunion. As far as we know, there's no relationship between somebody smoking and then getting a bunion. So we would expect one to be our answer. So if you then get an odds ratio or relative risk less than one that means that there's a negative association. That means that, if you're exposed to the risk factor you are less likely to get the disease, and if we're still using smoking, our example could be smoking and ulcerative colitis. For some reason, smoking is protective against the development of ulcerative colitis. So there is a negative association. All right, and that's the interpretation. The next thing that we need to talk about is, the number needed to treat a number needed to harm. Number needed to treat, is the number of people that you need to expose to some sort of treatment in order for one person to benefit. Ideally every person that you give treatment to would get some benefit from it, but in reality that's not how things actually work. Usually you need to give a lot of people warfarin in order to prevent one stroke. That's similar to number needed to harm. Number needed to harm is how many people do you need to expose to some sort of a risk factor in order for one person to be harmed by it? So how many people need to be taking warfarin, in order for one person to experience an adverse bleeding event? Now the way that you calculate this, is a little bit interesting. The number needed to treat is equal to one over ARR, and that stands for absolute risk reduction, and number needed to harm is equal to one over AR, which is attributable risk. ARR and AR, honestly are not that important, they just don't come up on test that much. We're going to go over, how you calculate them, but only because you need them in order to get to number needed to treat and number needed to harm, which are the more important things that we're talking about. So let me just make a box around this so you remember, number needed to treat a number needed to harm are the important things to remember. Okay. So, to calculate absolute risk reduction, ARR. What you do is you take C over C plus D, which is the probability of having the disease in people who have been exposed, minus A over A plus B, which is the probability of disease in people who have been exposed. Just to note, this is the same thing as this, and this is the same thing as this. If that helps you remember, great. If not, don't worry about it, and attributable risk, AR is just flipped. So then, it would be A over A plus B, minus the C over C plus D. I'm going to go over one more thing really quickly, it's relative risk reduction RRR, but this is just equal to one minus relative risk. That's really all you need to know about for relative risk reduction. All right. So to review, make sure that you know the difference between probability and odds, and definitely, make sure that you can recreate this table exactly with disease status on top, and exposure on the side, positive in the top left corner, A, B, C, D. Always the same. Make sure that you can remember how to calculate relative risk, and remember that it goes with cohort studies, make sure you can calculate odds ratio, and remember that it goes with case control, and remember how to interpret. Specifically remember, that if you have an odds ratio relative risk equal to one, there is no association, and that is risk. Become a better doctor.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Screening]  
﻿When we screen people, what we're trying to do is capture disease under the bell curve. Population statistics is about finding out what's good for society. That is, we don't want to do too much, but we want to be able to catch enough disease to help a bunch of people. So what we've come up with are screening guidelines based on studies we've done that tell us these things are good to do, because by doing them more people benefit and less people get harmed. You of course have to consider the number needed to treat, that is, how many times do you have to do this for someone to benefit versus the number needed to harm, how many times you need to do this for a complication, and then compare how bad the complications are relative to the perceived benefit. You don't have to do any of that. In this lecture let's just talk about what you do to screen, know what diseases, how to do it, and when to start. Two things, cancer and medical disease. Let's start off with cancers first. Cancer, when you start screening, how you screen, and when you stop. The most important cancer for the test is colon cancer, and you want to start screening for colon cancer at age 50 or 10 years before the first diagnosis. That is if your father got diagnosed with colon cancer at 42, you should be screened 32, age 50 or 10 years before the first diagnosis in a primary relative whichever one comes sooner. The reason why I put colon cancer at the top is because the way you screen is the most complicated, and any of these count, but if you change the number of frequency of year, you can make a right answer wrong or a wrong answer sound right. The best thing that you can do for colon cancer screening is a complete colonoscopy, and that is done every 10 years, but you can also do a flex sig every five years with fecal occult blood testing every three years, or you could do a fecal occult blood testing every year. Now you can see how they can see these words and then change the years and really screw you up. So as you remember this, colon is ten, flex is five with an FOBT three, FOBT one. Ten, five, three, one. It's in descending order. All of these are fine, and I use FOBT, fecal occult blood test to mean anyway of examining the stool for microscopic blood. You're going to hear about the FIT. For you, it is essentially the same as fecal occult blood testing. It doesn't matter which one you do, they are the same. You're going to continue colon cancer screening until 75, but there's pretty good evidence you should continue past 75, but for certain people. The idea is it takes about 10 years to develop from a polyp into cancer, which is why the colonoscopy is 10 years and you start 10 years from the first diagnosis. If you're going to live more than 10 years, you should probably have colon cancer screening continued. So definitely do colonoscopies until 75 and until 85 if they're really healthy. After that, don't put them through any unnecessary test. The next big cancer is breast, and the way we screen for breast cancer has changed a little bit, and you may still see people prescribing the old way of doing it. The test, that way is wrong even though some societies still recommend it, we are going to use the new recommendation. The old recommendation was to begin at 40 and screen every year. This is no longer the case. What we do -- do now is 50, begin age 50 and then screen every two years with mammography. The idea is something like this, if you do 40 Q1 [phonetics] you will catch more breast cancer, and that person that you found positive before age 50 may benefit, but this is about populations and statistics is about population level and cost-conscious care. Your patient in front of you may have a cancer and you don't diagnose it, but the problem is that the number of patients that need to receive that 40 Q1 actually harms more women than it helps. Women were going through lumpectomies and biopsies leading to abscess and lymphedema such that a false positive rate was too high causing too much morbidity. So 40 Q1 does catch more cancer, but isn't worth it at a statistics level, the population level. 50 Q2 balances, catching women with breast cancer, but reducing the morbidity associated with false positives. You continue until age 75. The other female cancer we screen for is cervical. The right answer is to start cervical cancer screening at age 21. The age at which you began having sex is absolutely irrelevant. Again, population under the bell curve. If you have a high-risk patient, like someone who has had AIDS since they were born and are now sexually active at 11, you might want to screen her for cervical cancer, but again, what likely happens in the general population is that even those girls who are exposed early on in adolescence clear the virus and don't have an increased risk. Therefore, the age of onset doesn't matter. Age 21, the way you screen is with a Pap every three years, and you continue doing Pap smears until either she's age 65 and has three consecutively normal Paps, or she had her cervix cut out, total abdominal hysterectomy. Now, there is another option that you can use for old women. I want you to learn 21 Q3. If you -- if you take a woman who is slightly older, you can do pap Q5 with HPV testing Q5. I don't want you to learn that, because it becomes more complicated and it's actually hard to read in the board intentionally. I want you to learn 21 Q3, but know in the back your head that there's this other option, and if you do HPV testing you can kind of delay them a little bit. That's more for women comfort rather than cervical cancer screening. The last cancer we screen for, that's right we only have four. The last cancer we screen for is lung cancer, and the people we screen for lung cancer are those between the ages of 55 and 80, and they have a 30-pack year history, and they quit less than 15 years ago, and that is including those who are still smoking. The way you screen for lung cancer is a low dose CT scan, and you do that every year. You do that until they're either age 80 or the time that they quit is more than 15 years ago. Note that doing an x-ray does not help with lung cancer. So you should not do them for screening. If you're going to screen someone for cancer, low dose CT. Now, I also want to point out some of the cancers that we do not screen for. Some you might be looking for them. We do not screen for prostate cancer. We used to do digital rectal exams plus screening PSAs, and some cancer society still recommend doing this especially for those who are high-risk, those who have someone who in their family who had prostate cancer. You should learn, do not screen. The reason why we don't do this anymore is the lead time bias. This is the same timeline of exactly the same person. Here they are now. They are going to die at exactly the same time. Their fate is fixed. What happens when we screen someone for prostate cancer is that we find prostate cancer, and so they live all this time with prostate cancer. If we didn't screen for them, they're still going to die the same time. We find that prostate cancer very close to their death, and so it looks like we've prolonged life. You've reduced mortality. This is the lead time. It turns out you die with prostate cancer, not from. Are there patients who will die from prostate cancer, of course, but at a population level it isn't worth it, because you put so many men through unnecessary procedures and biopsies leading to erectile dysfunction and incontinence that it's not worth it. The right answer is discuss with your patient whether or not they should, but really, what they're saying is don't screen for prostate cancer. The other thing to not screen for is ovarian cancer. We tried a lot of things. Serum markers and CA125, imaging with transvaginal ultrasound, and it turns out what happens is you get disease in very late stage, and it doesn't matter that you screen, because they're going to die anyway from their advanced disease. So don't screen ovarian cancer unless they're BRCA positive. More than that on the general surgery breast lecture. That's cancer, colon, breast, cervical, lung. Colon is 50 Q10, breast 50 Q2, cervical 21 Q3, lung cancer 55 to 80 who have smoked 30-pack years and quit less than 15, CTQ1. Let's change gears and go over medical disease. In the medical disease, you want to know what disease we're talking about, who you screen, and how you screen. There are three one-time diseases that you are going to see on your test, not maybe all three of them, but at least one. The first is the male disease and that's abdominal aortic aneurysm. You are going to screen those men who are greater than 65 and who have ever smoked. It's men and over 65 and who have ever smoked, unlike lung cancer, the pack here isn't considered. The way you screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm is with an ultrasound of the abdomen, but if the person has already had abdominal imaging, CT scan of the abdomen for example, for another reason, that counts. One-time screen after 65, look for the aneurysm. Its counterpart in women it is osteoporosis. You're going to screen women who are over the age of 65 and it's all women, and you're going to do that with a DEXA scan. You're testing their bone mineral density. If you have a negative score, what you're looking to do is treat her for osteoporosis with bisphosphonates. You're going to have the option for vitamin D, vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D and calcium are prophylactic and should be done after menopause. Vitamin D, 50,000 units per week should be done if there's vitamin D deficiency, but if you find a positive DEXA scan that is she does have osteoporosis, treated with bisphosphonates. That's the right answer, and the one that's gained a lot of ground, men and women, is Hep C, and it's Hep C because we have a treatment for it. Anyone who is a baby boomer gets screened once. Now, it makes sense to me that you would do more than that. People use needle drugs, have HIV, but the USPSTF has a recommendation, the Hep C antibody is reserved for everyone who is born between the ages of 1945 and 1965. One-time screen. This next few are going to be just general health screening which is still useful, but these are the ones come up on the test most often. HIV, everybody gets a screen once, and you do it through an ELISA. If the ELISA is positive, you confirm before you tell them they have a HIV. It's everyone once and then any time someone wants one. It's called a risky behavior or engagement and risky activity. Really, it means that if someone comes in and requests an HIV test, you give it to them. If you think they might have HIV, you give it to them. If they're sexually active, they can get an HIV screen, screen for HIV, and then some of the cardiovascular diseases, which are very popular on testing, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Hypertension, everyone gets screened every visit. A blood pressure is taken as part of the vital signs and they're screening for hypertension. However, the diagnosis is made two consecutive blood pressures separated by two weeks, because there might be some element of anxiety, panic, rushing, or white coat hypertension, but the best way to diagnose hypertension is ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. That is the person goes home, takes their own blood pressure and writes it down on a piece of paper. That's because the person may have left work, skip a half today in order to go to the doctor, or rushed across town and is very excited and panic that they're late and would be made to wait 30 minutes in the waiting room and finally get their blood pressure. Or white coat hypertension where they come to the clinic, they get anxious their blood pressure goes up. Doing it at home at the same time on multiple days is a better way to diagnose hypertension, and diabetes is surprising, because you think the person who get screened for diabetes would be someone who looks like the type of person who might get it, but the USPTF says people who have hypertension should be screened for diabetes, not obesity, and you do so with an A1C. I want you to hear that the two-hour glucose tolerance test is a thing, but is largely been replaced by the A1C except in the setting of gestational diabetes, where the two-hour glucose tolerance test is a backup to the one and three-hour test. Diabetes, those who have hypertension, get an A1C. Dyslipidemia, now remember, as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, being 45 for a man or 55 for a woman. The numbers are different, but see that 10-degree difference. See why I emphasized 10-degree in a minute. It is said that those who should be screened for dyslipidemia are men greater than equal to 35 all comers or those who are greater than 20 with risk factors for coronary artery disease. See the 10 difference. In women, who are greater and equal to 45, 10 difference, 10 difference, or those greater than 20 with risk factors. This is implying that basically everybody who goes to the doctor is going to get screened for cholesterol, and the way you do that is with a lipid panel, and we know now that the main way to treat dyslipidemia is with statins, and you do everything you can to get them on a statin. To all the things you can do in clinic to help people, especially the elderly, are going to be things that most people miss. Right? So you do want to screen some people especially geriatric population for depression and for mobility. Now, don't worry so much about who, because these are the less strong recommendations, but things you can do are screen people for depression using the PHQ-9. What is that? Don't worry about it. Just know the PHQ-9. Screen them for depression, ask them the questions and see if they have any problems, and the other thing to do is mobility tester, get up and go. Do they have the balance and coordination necessary to pop out of a chair or should they be taking it a little bit slower and maybe need some walking assistance like a walker or cane. Cancer, colon, breast, cervical, lung. Medical disease, AAA, 65 men, osteoporosis, 65 women. Hep C, baby boomers. HIV, everyone. Hypertension, everyone every visit. Diabetes, those who have hypertension use the A1C and not the glucose tolerance test, and dyslipidemia they're going to be everybody, treat with statins. Don't forget about geriatric population or mood disorder and mobility disorders really creep up on them and cause a major impact on their life. That's screening. Become a better doctor.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Study Design]  
﻿There are a handful of different study designs that you need to be familiar with, but let's start with incidence and prevalence of disease. Incidence that looks at all the people who are newly diagnosed with the disease in a given period of time. It's typically a year. Compare that to prevalence which looks at all the people who have the disease right now. So if this is everybody, everybody who can possibly have the disease ever, everybody who's at risk and I want to look at how many people were diagnosed with diabetes this year, and it's this little segment right here. This is the incidence of diabetes. Since diabetes is a diagnosis that sticks around for a while, it's a chronic illness, the number of people who have the diagnosis at any given period of time is going to be greater than the number of people who were newly diagnosed. So if I wanted to look at the total number of people who have diabetes right now, it would include the people who were newly diagnosed and then a lot more. It would look like that. So that would be prevalence of diabetes. All right. On to the different kinds of studies. We can broadly break up study design based on whether or not there is an intervention. An intervention is anything that a researcher does to people in the study. It can be a new medicine, it can be a pamphlet, it can be an old treatment, whatever. It's just something that the researcher does or gives to the people in the study, and if there is no intervention, what you have is an observational study, and this can be broken down even further based on whether or not your observational study includes a comparison. If there is no comparison, if you're just describing something, you have a descriptive study and it's going to be one of two that you need to know about. You have either a case series or you have a cross sectional study. A case series is just what it sounds like, it's a series of cases. So this is something where somebody noticed a few interesting people who have a disease and they just wanted to describe it. You get, kind of, a -- you get qualitative information, not really any quantitative data, and it's presented as a narrative. So if a case series is where you just notice something, a cross-sectional study is where you start looking into a little bit more. You start asking questions. In a cross-sectional study, you ask a question of a group of people once at a single point in time. You can do this to assess prevalence. It's like taking a snapshot of traits of a group at that one moment. All right. On to observational studies that have a comparison group. We can break this down based on what are the groups that you're comparing. If you're comparing the same group of people repeatedly over time, what you have is a longitudinal study, and you can think of a longitudinal study as a series of cross-sectional studies. You send out a survey or something once to a group of people and you do it again, and you do it again at the next year, you do it again the next year. It's just a bunch of cross-sectional studies, and this is really useful for assessing change and prevalence. Okay. So for these next two, you have to actually start really paying attention, because the next two study designs that I'm going to talk about are the most important ones of the whole video. So if the groups that you're comparing are people who have the disease that you're looking at versus people who do not have the disease. So you're comparing based on disease status. What you have is a case control study, because cases are people who have the disease and controls are people who do not have the disease, and if you're comparing people based on exposure status, so whether or not they have been exposed to a risk factor. What you have is a cohort study. Now, both case control and cohort studies, they're both looking at the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and then the development of a disease. They're looking at this question from different angles. Let me explain a little bit. So the way that we like to think about disease is that there is some kind of an exposure. Maybe it's to a stressful home environment or it's air pollution, whatever. There's this exposure that happens and then later on you develop a disease. We like to think about with the exposure happening before the disease. In a cohort study, which is prospective. Prospective means looking forward, you start with the exposure. You find a group of people who have been exposed to something and then you follow them over time, and you ask, do they develop the disease? And all the while you've also been following people who have not been exposed so that you can compare them. So in a cohort study you are comparing two groups based on exposure status and for people who have been exposed to a risk factor and people who have not been exposed to a risk factor, which group ends up getting the disease more often, and you do this calculation using something called relative risk. You don't need to know too much more about what relative risk is right now, just try and remember that relative risk goes with cohort studies. I will explain a lot more about it in a later video. Okay. So an example of a cohort study might be something like finding a group of people who have chosen themselves to receive the flu vaccine, and finding a group of people who did not get the flu vaccine this year, and then we follow them throughout the flu season and compare among those two groups which group gets the flu more often. Compare that to a case control study. Case control studies are retrospective that means they look backwards. So the group that we use here for case control is disease status. We start here with disease. We find a group of people with the disease and we ask them, think back in your history, were you ever exposed to this risk factor? And we also ask a group of people who do not have the disease. So an example might be if we were looking at mesothelioma, which is great because it is a rare disease and case control studies are great for rare diseases. So we get a group of people who have the disease, who have mesothelioma, and we also get a group of people who do not have mesothelioma, and we asked both groups, do you remember being exposed to asbestos, and then we compare between those two groups, how often they remember having the exposure, and we make this comparison using something called an odds ratio, and like relative risk, it's important but we're not going to talk about it here. There's going to be another video. Just remember that odds ratio goes with case control. All right so those are the observational studies. Just to note observational studies cannot establish causation. So what that means is you cannot use an observational study to say that an exposure, a specific exposure causes a specific outcome. You can only say that there's an association there. If you want to be able to say that an exposure caused an outcome, you need an intervention, and studies that have interventions are called experimental studies, and just remember, that an intervention is something that a researcher gives to people in the experiment. If you want to have a good experiment, you need to also have something called a control group, and this is to make comparisons. So the intervention receives the thing, whatever it is that the researcher is giving the study group. This is what we're interested in studying. The control group receives anything except for the thing that we are looking at, not the intervention, not the thing. So this can be a placebo, so people think that they are getting the intervention when they're actually not. It can be an existing treatment, usually in the standard of care, or it can be nothing at all. The point is that it is not the intervention, and if you want to have a good experimental study, you should also have something called randomization. This is where you decide who gets the intervention and who gets not the intervention, and you do it just using random chance like a coin flip, and that's how you assign the group, control versus intervention, and really quickly, I just want to mention a type of study called a crossover study. It's really cool. It's where people who were in the control group half way through the study switch and receive the intervention, and likewise, people who were receiving the intervention switch and receive the control, and they cross over, so this is called a crossover study design. This is really cool, because people act as their own control and it is a great way to minimize bias. Now, bias is something that we haven't mentioned yet, but it's really important. It gets its own video, but the purpose of having a control group is to minimize bias, and the purpose of randomizing who goes to what group is also to minimize bias. Bias is bad, we want as little as possible. Okay. Speaking of bias, how much bias an experimental study gets is, kind of, another way that we can break down experimental studies. So it's -- actually we're going to be asking who gets blinded in our experimental study, and what blinding means is hiding the group assignment, and you can blind the patient so they don't know whether they are in the intervention or the control group or you can also blind the researcher so they don't know which group the patient has been assigned to. So if no one is blinded, if everybody knows what group they're in, if the patients know that they're getting the placebo or they know that they're getting the treatment and the researchers know too, what you have is an open label study. Open label studies are not preferred, because they have the greatest risk of bias, because everybody knows what group they're in, but sometimes you can't avoid it, so you're kind of, stuck. What would be better is if you can blind at least the patient. So the patient doesn't know whether they're getting the intervention or they're getting something else. This reduces the amount of bias and this gives you a single blind study. So you have less bias here, but you still have some, because the experimenter or the researcher knows what group. So better still is if you can blind both the patient and the researcher. This results in a double-blind study. These are most preferred, because they have the least amount of bias of these three study designs. So to review, bias is bad and in experimental studies we use control groups and randomization and blinding to minimize bias. Within observational studies, there are two important study designs that you need to be able to tell the difference between and those are case control and cohorts studies. Look out for my video on risk to learn more about these, and that is study design. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Vaccinations]  
﻿This lecture is going to be a pretty quick review of what you need to know about vaccines in America. First thing, if you have foreign travel we're not going to cover those diseases or those vaccines. In pediatrics, in infectious rashes and pediatrics vaccinations, we go over the diseases that are caused by the bugs we vaccinate against. We're not going to do that here. We're going to emphasize adult vaccinations when you need to give them and when you can't. So let's start with that when you can't. What is a true contraindication to somebody getting a vaccine? The first thing you have to look out for and is absolutely contraindication is going to be anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction to a medication or a vaccine. And generally, if you have an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine, you shouldn't get that vaccine again. Most vaccines require multiple doses and so, you find another way to protect that person. The second one comes up a lot is going to be eggs, and egg allergy. And this is because in the past we have grown our vaccines in eggs. And so, people who have a true anaphylactic reaction to eggs were put at risk and said not to have these vaccines. For the most part, we don't make vaccines in eggs anymore strictly because of this purpose. Therefore, the things that used to be a contraindication like the intramuscular flu and the MMRV are no longer contraindicated. The flu IM is a plus minus and so, what we've done is created the flu intranasal, a live attenuated vaccine that can be used if someone has an anaphylactic reaction to the intramuscular version. I'm going to put a dash line through flu intramuscular because very soon you will not have this as a consideration. But one, you still do want to make sure because you don't want to cause an anaphylactic reaction and two, because the test may not have caught up yet to the fact that we're making our flu vaccines free of eggs. I'm going to put a line through intranasal because intranasal is not made in eggs, but it is live attenuated which we'll talk about next. I'm going to put a line through the MMRV which used to be made in eggs and no longer is. That is to say you probably going to have a tough time predicting which vaccine is going to cause anaphylaxis. So it's only those people who have had a bad reaction in the past that is anaphylactic and not just a little red or sore that can't have them. The idea being, give the vaccines. The last thing to consider is the live attenuated. Live attenuated vaccines or contraindicated in anyone who is immunosuppressed. And usually, this means really bad immunosuppression, biologics for transplants, HIV, really old or really young. These vaccines are live attenuated, so that means you can give them the actual virus by giving them the vaccine. But they must be profoundly immunocompromised and they have to go out of their way to tell you, I really shouldn't have this. Someone who's got a CD4 count of four may not take to the vaccine. That is their immune system may not be robust enough to develop the immune response. But if you give someone with a CD count of four a live attenuated vaccine, you may actually inoculate them and give them the disease. The things you want to watch out for for immunodepressed patients is going to be the intranasal flu, the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and zoster. There really isn't a way to get around this, you're going to of course use intramuscular fluid if there's no egg anaphylaxis. If they are profoundly immunocompromised, you should not give them these vaccines. And instead, you should vaccinate them before they become immunocompromised or wait for them to get better before you do. Again, the emphasis here is if you're considering giving someone a vaccine, it's probably the right answer and they should get it. But now I want to talk about the individual vaccines and that is, you want to break it down by vaccine, how often you should get it, when you start and how frequently. And then what really is a problem or a contraindication to getting this particular vaccine. Because we've learned, the global stuff really shouldn't prohibit someone from getting a vaccine. The one you're probably going to get a test question about is Tdap. Not to be confused with the Dtap, also, tetanus toxoid or tetanus diphtheria. This gets very convoluted very quickly which you can see with four options how this could very easily become a test question. The capital D in Dtap is for a much higher dose than in the Tdap. You give a much higher dose when you're trying to prime a weak immune system. Dtap is for kids. Don't pick Dtap for adults. Tetanus toxoid and TD, tetanus diphtheria are the options you have when you can't give a Tdap. These are never going to be the right answer on their own. The CDC even says this, if you have an opportunity to give the Tdap, give it. Which means it's going to be the answer to give the vaccine. What you're supposed to do is give this every ten years for three lifetime doses. And the question you are going to get on the test is going to be, what do you do with the wound? Forget clean wounds, those are easy. What you want to look at is how many lifetime doses they've had and when the last one was. If you've had greater than three lifetime doses, you're good. Which means you can simply clean the wound if it's been less than 10 years since your last one or give a booster if it's greater than 10 years. If you've had less than three lifetime doses, you're going to need to give a booster if it's been less than five years. And the booster plus IVIG if it's been greater than five years. That's a long winded one to understand and we talked a lot about this in the peds vaccination lecture. What I want to see is Q ten years, three doses. And then break it down by how many lifetime doses you've had versus how close are you. And notice I wrote TD. That's the booster. It's okay to use that after you've had a whole bunch of doses and Tdap. But it's also okay to use Tdap when you give a booster. When you have an opportunity to give Tdap, give it. Contraindication here is going to be anaphylaxis. And this is one of those you get a bunch of times, so you'll know if there's a problem. The test question won't do this to you, but if you have a bad reaction to Tdap, which has three things in it, you might drop the acellular pertussis to do the next one and see if a bad reaction occurs. The goal is to prevent disease. And if you lose the acellular pertussis and that's the thing that cause anaphylaxis, you can still give the tetanus booster. A pneumococcal vaccine is actually just as confusing. And so, I'm going to make it simple. What I want you to hear is once before 60 and then once after 65. There's a lot to know in here and I'm carving it down to bare bones. You are going to use the 23 valent for a person who is older than 65. You are going to use the 13 valent for someone who is less than 60. You should complete a 13 series as a child. You can get a 13 again as an adult. The people who need it are those people who have disease, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes. Basically, if you're a medical patient, you need the shot. But the people who absolutely must have it is everybody over the age of 65. Keep it simple, once before 60, once after 65. And those who know a lot about this vaccine know why I'm saying what I'm saying. I want you to remember before 60 and after 65. And just to emphasize the point, you never, never give 13 and 23 at the same time. How would you do that? 13's before 60, 23's after 65. The zoster vaccine prevents shingles, and the recommendation is everybody gets the zoster vaccine regardless of your varicella disease state. That's going to change as the kids who currently get the varicella vaccine don't have chicken pox. You can't get shingles unless you've had chicken pox. But those people who are older than 30, did not get varicella vaccinations and they're going to need zoster. Zoster prevents shingles, shingles hurts, post herpetic neuralgia, bad stuff, everybody who is over the age of 60 needs a zoster shot. Now, zoster is live attenuated. So those who are truly immunosuppressed should wait till they're no longer immunosuppressed in order to get the zoster vaccine. Influenza must be given to everybody. It is everybody every year without fail. Healthcare workers, nursing home residents, show up to the clinic, show up to the Wal-Mart, show to Walgreens, show up to the street corner where they happen to be handing out the flu vaccine. Everybody gets a flu vaccine and it happens every year. Just remember there's this thing plus minus eggs for the intramuscular and live attenuated for the intranasal. You have to have a really, really, really strong suspicion that the interim muscular injections going to cause a problem in order to give it. HPV vaccine prevents cancer. Sounds like a pretty good thing to me. And now, it is indicated for everyone 9 to 26 boys and girls, if boys get vaccinated they can't give it to the girls when they have sex later. If the girls have the vaccine, it doesn't matter of the boys give it to them because the girls are vaccinated against it. It prevents cervical cancer and there's literally no reason not to get it. Specifically receiving the HPV vaccine does not increase sexual activity or risk-taking behavior. Being protected just to keep them protected. In the last one of sort of the adolescent vaccinations is the meningococcal. It prevents meningitis and its neisseria meningitidis, this the one that kills you in 24 hours, so everybody should get this. But the people who must have it are going to be those who are going to be near other people who might have it and kill a bunch of people. That is those in college dormitories and those going to the military, army barracks. In American society, it's everybody, but specifically those who go to college or army barracks. There is no reason not to get this. I do want to revisit some of the pediatric vaccines just in case you hadn't watched that lecture yet to emphasize a few points. Hib causes epiglottitis. If you give the vaccine, kids don't die of epiglottitis. Give the Hib vaccine. Hep A and Hep B vaccines, everybody should get. What I want you to remember is that there are two doses of A and three doses of B. What's important for adults is that if there is a record of Hep A B vaccination and it's incomplete, you can simply complete or pick up where you left off. You do not need to start again. If you have no idea or no records of what their -- Hep A B status is, don't get titers, just revaccinated. And lastly, is the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, everybody gets this. We talk more about the measles mumps rubella varicella vaccine in peds infectious rashes. We talked more about hepatitis B and what to do during birth, during peds vaccinations. We talked more about the Hib vaccine and epiglottitis in the pediatric lectures. Upper airway, HPV is discussed in cervical cancer in the GYN sections, and Tdap is discussed in more detail in the peds vaccinations lecture. So what I want to point out is that there are very few reasons that someone should not get a vaccine. Personal choice is one of them, that's an ethical issue, they should get the vaccine. Everybody should get vaccines. The Tdap is every ten years for three doses total. Worry about the dirty wound thing in that peds lecture. Pneumococcal, once before 60 and once after 65. It's not true, but if you remember that you're going to get it right most of the time. Zoster greater than 60, everybody gets it unless you're immunosuppressed. Flu vaccine, everybody every year, don't worry about that egg thing or you also have the option to use intranasal, which is used when there's an anaphylactic reaction to IM and you are not immunosuppressed. HPV cures cancer before it shows up, we prevent cancer, and everybody gets it. Meningococcal vaccine, everyone should get that one too, but it is necessary for college and the military, and don't forget about the kid ones, you have Hib, epiglottitis, Hep A, B, complete the series wherever you left off, and MMRV prevent these diseases by giving that vaccine. That is preventative vaccinations. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Anterior Chapman Points]  
﻿In this lecture, we're going to discuss Chapman's points. And unfortunately, it's nother memorization lecture. Instead of showing a chart, I'm going to demonstrate how I was taught how to draw out the Chapman's points. It's the only thing that worked for me, so I'm going to teach it for you. The Chapman's point is a two or three millimeter papule that represents a viscerosomatic reflex located on the anterior or posterior side of the body. What they are used for now is really to help aid in diagnosis, and not necessarily for treatment. So we're going to go ahead and demonstrate how to draw these things out. So we're going to draw some clavicles and then twelve ribs, and draw our midline. So there are a couple points located around the clavicle and rib 1. You have the ear, the nose and the pharynx. Next we're going to move into the inner space where you have the tonsils, the larynx and the tongue, and finally the sinus. So the next points are going to be outlined in the rib interspaces. So you put a point here, three points here, and then points going all the way back up. You can number your ribs so you know which rib interspace you are in to help you keep these straight. This first dot in the second rib interspace is for the heart. Continue to move down, and this one's for stomach acid. The next is for stomach motility, then you have the spleen. Moving over, you have the pancreas, the liver and gallbladder, another point for the liver, the lower lungs and the upper lung. This final point is almost a grab bag. You have the thyroid, you have the bronchus, you have the esophagus and the myocardium. To finish off the points on the anterior side of your ribs, you can place three points like this. These three points bilaterally are going to represent your small intestine. The next set of points are around your belly button on your abdomen, so this will be your belly button. One inch lateral and one inch superior you have another point, and one inch superior to that is another. These represent the adrenal gland, the kidney and the area around the umbilicus is for the bladder. There are some Chapman's points located in your pelvic area. So imagine this is one of your innominates. You have a point at the pubic tubercle, which represents the ovary and the urethra. And another point located more inferior that represents the uterus. The next points are going to be located on the anterior side of your thighs, and they represent the colon. So we all know how the colon runs, where you have the ascending transverse, descending and sigmoid. Just imagine that and flip it over on itself, and that will represent the locations for the colon Chapman's points on your thighs. So if we're going to draw this out, it will look like this, where we have the cecum, the descending colon, portions of the transverse colon, running back over to the sigmoid like so. Then imagine that our thigh is right here, and this is the rest of the foot, to demonstrate. There's another point back here for the prostate. That's going to be located on the posterior side of your thigh. There are two other random ones that don't really fit into the organizer anywhere, so we're going to have to write them out. So the coracoid will represent the cerebellum, and finally the most random point of all of them, on the lateral superior humerus, that's going to represent your retina and your conjunctiva. So this is how I was taught to remember the Chapman's points. I hope it helps you remember where the Chapman's points are as well, instead of having to memorize the chart. Where we talked about the anterior Chapman's points located in the rib area, if you can see, it kind of makes sense as you go from the superior side of the body to the inferior, you have a group of ENT, then you have the heart and upper lungs, and as you move further down in the body, you're going to reach the stomach, the liver, the pancreas and the small intestine. Everything over here is more difficult stuff to remember. And that's OMM Chapman's points. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Autonomic Levels]  
﻿Autonomics is one of the most high yield topics that we're going to go over in this course. Up until now, we've talked about dysfunction in terms of muscle, bone, attachment, insertion, and things that you can physically palpate. But this is completely different. We're going to be talking about visceral and organ dysfunction and relating that to a somatic dysfunction. So the important concept that you need to be able to do is relate the somatic level of where you may find a dysfunction, and relate that back to a visceral dysfunction or an organ dysfunction. You need to be able to flip that backward as well. If there is some sort of visceral issue, you need to be able to anticipate where you can palpate that as a somatic finding. The visceral organs are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. And the autonomic nervous system can be divided into two sections. You have the sympathetics and the parasympathetics. We're not going to go over what happens to each organ for sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow, but just remember sympathetics are your fight or flight response, and parasympathetics are more rest and digest. So when you're thinking parasympathetics, think pieces on the time. So to start off with, we're going to go over the sympathetic levels. So the way that I'm going to divide this out is I'm going to write out each level and what structures are innervated by it, but I'm also going to draw a picture in the same color to help it stick a little bit better. So we're going to start off with T1 to T6. In this range, you're going to think of the head, the neck, esophagus, the heart and the lungs. So as a picture, you have the head, the neck, the esophagus, the heart and the lungs. So the next level is going to be T5 through T9. When you think of a ganglia here, think of the celiac ganglia. The organs that are going to be innervated for this level include the stomach, duodenum, the pancreas, the liver, the gallbladder and the spleen. So to draw that out, you have the stomach, the liver the gallbladder, the pancreas and the spleen. And finally, the duodenum. So the next level we have T10 and T11. When you're thinking of ganglia here, think of the superior mesenteric ganglia, and for organs being innervated, think about the remainder of the small intestine after the duodenum, the cecum, the appendix, the ascending colon, the first half of the transverse colon, the kidneys, the upper ureters, and finally the gonads. Now you're thinking T10 and 11 for the gonads, why is that? Male gonads are so low, why is it innervated by T10 and 11? So think about embryologically, the gonads begin up in the abdomen around T10 and T11. Throughout the development process, the gonads descend into the scrotal sac, whereas the ovaries just stay where they are. So remember, gonads are strange. T10, T11. So drawing that out, we have the remainder of the small intestine, we have the cecum, the ascending colon and the first half of the transverse colon, as well as the appendix. We also have the kidneys and the upper ureters. So now the final level, T12 through L2. When you're thinking of a ganglia, think of the inferior mesenteric ganglia. When you're thinking of structures that are going to be innervated here, think of the rest of the colon, the lower ureters, the bladder, the prostate and the rest of your sex organs, excluding the gonads. So drawing that out, we're going to have the rest of the colon, the lower part of the ureters, the bladder, the prostate and all of your sex organs except for the gonads. So you're looking at the picture, one thing that you may realize is that everything is innervated in a top down approach. So you have the head and neck, the upper area. You have the upper gastric area, the middle area, and so on and so forth. The only weird part is going to be the GI tract, so you have to think about where exactly the food is passing along the tract as you're eating, to think about innervation levels. And remember, the only really weird one is the gonads. So now we're going to transition over to the parasympathetic levels. This section's going to be a lot easier than the sympathetic levels, because there's only two options. We also don't have to suffer through any more drawings. So the two options that we have are the vagus nerve and the pelvic splanchnic nerves. So how exactly is this divided? One line right there. Everything above the line will have vagus parasympathetic innervation. And everything below it will be pelvic splanchnic. And that's it for parasympathetics, super easy. So how are we going to be treating these? Well, when you're doing autonomic treatments, the main thing that you have to remember is your treatment will not increase outflow. What it's going to do is decrease the innervation facilitation. So when you're doing the treatment, you're trying to decrease the sympathetics or you're trying to decrease the parasympathetic outflow to the area. So for your treatment, you're trying to down regulate the sympathetics. You're going to try paraspinal inhibition. And the most common paraspinal inhibition that students know is rib raising. So if you are trying to decrease sympathetic facilitation to one of these organs, you go to the level and you perform the rib raising treatment. You can also perform a direct ganglia release. The ganglia are the ones that we outlined. So direct ganglia release. So how about parasympathetic? It's going to be different if you're trying to treat the vagus or the pelvic splanchnics. So vagus, you're going to want to treat the OA, and for the pelvic splanchnics, you're going to want to treat the sacrum. When you're treating the sacrum, you're going to think of inhibitory techniques. So you can think of sacral rocking and facilitation maneuvers. So the autonomics, the important thing that you have to know is being able to relate the visceral dysfunction back to your somatic level finding. You also need to be able to flip it and say if you find a somatic dysfunction in a certain area, they might be trying to point you toward some sort of visceral dysfunction. So we went over all of the sympathetic levels, suffered through another picture, and then talked about the parasympathetics and the treatment style. And that's OMM for autonomics. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Cervical Spine Diagnosis and HVLA]  
﻿In this lecture, we're going to be talking about the cervical region. This lecture is going to be divided into two parts. The first part is we're going to learn how to diagnose the cervical vertebra, and then we're going to move into an important muscle that's also located in the neck, the sternocleidomastoid. So in the previous video, we just found out how to diagnose the thoracic spine. Why do we need to learn it again? So doing the same diagnostic pattern for the cervical spine will not work. It's going to be different. And it's different because there's no Fryette's laws. So when you're diagnosing the thoracic spine, you cannot use Fryette's laws. You have a completely different set. So before we go into that, we have to know what the primary motion of each cervical vertebrae is. So your first area is C0, which is also known as the OA. The primary motion of this segment is flexion and extension. This will come into play when we start doing our diagnostics. So the next one is C1, which is also the AA. Primary motion here is rotation. Then you have C2 through 4. The primary motion is also rotation. And then you have the bottom cervical, you have C5 through C7. The primary motion here is going to be side bending. So how is the diagnostic pattern different? You're going to go through the same flow of assessing in neutral, assessing in flexion and assessing in extension. But instead of looking at rotation, you're going to be looking at translation and side bending. And the rules that that's going to follow is going to be on this chart. So for C0 and C1, side bending and rotation occur in opposite directions, meaning that if on an exam or in the clinic you're palpating the area and you notice that the patient can side bend to the left, you know that rotation is in the opposite direction. So they can rotate to the right. When you're assessing for this side bending, you're going to use what's called translation. So what is translation? Imagine that you're palpating the back side of the cervical spine. What you're going to do is you're going to use your fingers and push side to side on the cervical spine. So you're translating from one side to the other. So if I'm pushing from the right to the left, this is going to be left translation. But this is where people will get tripped up. You're doing left translation, but when you're making that motion, the cervical vertebra collapse to the right, and this induces right side bending. So if someone tells you that you can translate to the left, they're basically saying that you can side bend to the right. So that's how you translate. So going back to C2 and C7, side bending and rotation here are going to be different. They are going to rotate in the same direction. And how do you assess for this motion is the same, translation. So why is C1 written in red? It's a little bit different than the rest of them. Instead of trying to do translation, you're going to induce rotation. So what you're going to do is you're going to flex the spine to the level to 45 degrees, and then you are going to rotate the patient's head. This rotation is then going to tell you what direction you can and cannot rotate. And then using the same rule, you can tell that rotation and side bending occur in the opposite direction. So if they can rotate to the right, then they can side bend to the left. So let's go through a couple practice questions. So for this first one, in the exam they tell you that during flexion, the patient can side bend both directions normally. But during extension, the patient cannot side bend to the left. And let's say that these findings are for C4. So what's the diagnosis? So you follow the same rules. You always name it by what it can do. So looking back at the question, it can go into flexion normally, and it can side bend normally during flexion. So you can already say it's C4, flexed, something. You know it's going to be rotated and side bent to some direction. They tell you that during extension, you cannot side bend to the left. Remember, you always have to name a dysfunction by what it can do. So if it cannot side bend to the left, that means that it can side bend to the right. So can side bend to the right. And then following our rules for rotation and side bending, C4, side bending and rotation are in the same direction, so you're going to be C4 flexed, rotated right, side bent right. So for the next example, they tell you that during flexion you cannot translate to the left. This means that when they try and translate to the left, it doesn't want to go. But during extension, totally fine with translation. So translation is fine in both directions during extension. Let's say our findings are for C4, what's the diagnosis? Once again, same flow chart as always. You always name it by what it can do. So we're going to say C4 in extension translation is normal, so it's an extended dysfunction. You know it's going to be rotated and side bent in some direction. So they tell you that during flexion you cannot translate to the left. This means that you can translate to the right. But when you translate to the right, you have to remember that you are inducing left side bending. So it's a really important concept to understand which direction you're translation and what side bending direction that induces. So if you cannot translate to the left, that means that you can translate to the right, which means that you are inducing left side bending. So side bending to the left. And since it's C4, follow our chart, side bending and rotation are in the same direction. So our diagnosis is C4 extended, rotated left, side bent to the left. So now how do we treat this dysfunction? You can treat it many different ways, like we talked about in the previous lectures. You can do muscle energy, you can do HVLA, you can even do counterstrain if you want to. It's all up to what you're comfortable with, because there's no right answer for which one is better. So in this discussion, it'll be easier to give a demonstration on HVLA. So HVLA. So as we discussed previously, HVLA is a direct technique, meaning that we engage the restrictive barrier or we engage what the patient cannot do. And it's also passive. Passive means that the patient does not assist during treatment. They're totally relaxed. The practitioner does everything for the patient. There are some contraindications to HVLA, which you need to be looking out for in your patients and on the exam. If they give you one of these contraindications, HVLA is not the right answer. You need to pick a different treatment style. So what are the contraindications? So you have osteoporosis. You can have fractures and metastatic cancer. So just think about it this way. Osteoporosis, fractures and metastatic bone cancer can lead to a weakness in the vertebra. You don't want to be cracking weak vertebra, so don't do HVLA, you'll cause more damage than good. So what are some other contraindications? Rheumatoid arthritis and Down syndrome. So a contraindication to rheumatoid and Down is going to be the same thing. For both of these diagnoses, you have an unstable transverse ligament. Because of this instability, you are not able to perform and HVLA treatment technique because you'll cause harm. So if you see any of these, you are not allowed to treat the patient with HVLA. You have to pick something else. Easy way to remember this is that older individuals like Granny might have osteoporosis, fractures, cancer, maybe she's got rheumatoid. Don't be cracking Granny's neck. Choose something else. So there are two different types of HVLA treatments. You can have rotational HVLA, and you can have side bending HVLA. Both of these treatment styles are very similar in that they're direct and passive, but the setup is just slightly different, and I'll go through an example with the cervical spine. So let's say that you have a diagnosis of C5 FRS right. So I'm saying that's C5, can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. So how am I going to set this up for treatment? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the patient into the barrier, because it's a direct treatment. So put them into the position that they cannot do. So I'm going to induce slight extension. It's a rotational HVLA technique, so I'm going to set them into the rotational barrier first. So we're going to rotate to the left and then the last plane of motion is side bending. So I'm going to side bend to the left. The next part of the treatment is to get the patient to relax. You want them to take a couple deep breaths, get chilled out. It's easier to perform the HVLA technique when the patient is relaxed and they're not constricting their muscles anticipating an HVLA press. So wait until they're relaxed, instruct the patient to breathe. So the next step is one that they are totally relaxed, you can then induce your HVLA force. Because this is a rotational HVLA treatment, you're HVLA movement is going to be in rotation through the direct barrier. So you're going to HVLA, rotate left. So you're going to perform the rotary force through the barrier, which is to the left. After you perform the treatment, you are then going to passively return the patient to neutral and then you're going to rescreen. So remember, after any treatment, whether it's HVLA, muscle energy or whatever, you have to return the patient to neutral and you have to rescreen to see if your treatment worked. So now for side bending HVLA. Let's say once again our diagnosis is the same. So we'll say C5, FRS right. C5 can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. It's still a direct technique, so we're going to set him up into the barrier. So we're going to induce slight extension, it's a side bending treatment, so we're going to do side bending first into the barrier. So we're going to side bend to the left and this is where it's a little bit different for the cervical HVLA. Instead of rotating into the barrier, you're going to rotate into the freedom. So you're going to rotate right. The reason that you rotate right for this treatment is so that you can lock out the facets for everything above and below it for your treatment. So it really directs the treatment towards C5 and not anywhere else. So the important thing for you to see here is that rotation goes to the freedom for side bending, but it goes into the barrier for rotation. The rest of the steps are exactly the same. So you're going to have the patient relax. Once he's relaxed, you're going to do your HVLA force. Because it's a side bending HVLA treatment, you're going to induce your HVLA force through translation to the right. So this is where you have to remember, translating to the right means that you're inducing left side bending, and that is the barrier that you're going for, left side bending. So once you've done your HVLA thrusts, you then return the patient back to neutral and just like any other treatment, you always rescreen. So this is where we're going to break the lecture and stop talking about vertebra and we're going to start talking about a very important muscle that's located in the neck, the SCM, the sternocleidomastoid. So the SCM has two origins. It has a sternal head, which originates on the manubrium, so right at the top of the sternum. You have the clavicular head, which originates on the medial one-third of the clavicle. So the sternal head originates on the manubrium, the clavicular head originates on the medial one-third of the clavicle. The attachment is going to be the mastoid process. So now that you know where the SCM originates and where it attaches or inserts, you can now get an idea of what the SCM does when it contracts. So if your origin and insertion are here and you're contracting your muscle to bring the origin and the insertion closer together, you're inducing flexion, side bending towards, and rotating away. So as I'm making this motion, the origin and attachment are coming closer together. So what happens when the SCM is dysfunctional? Well, if you think about when the muscle is dysfunctional and it becomes hypertonic, it's going to shorten and it's going to try and stay very locked up in this position of what it can do. So if you know the anatomy, then you already know what happens during dysfunction. It does exactly what it does during normal motion, it just gets stuck that way. So the freedom for this dysfunction is going to be flexion, side bending towards and rotating away. The barrier of this dysfunction is going to be the opposite, or what it cannot do. So the barrier is extension, side bending away, rotating towards. Again, when the SCM is hypertonic, it wants to do this, it cannot do the opposite. So how do I do the treatment? So once again, this is going to be a recurring theme throughout the entire thing. You need to understand the concepts and then apply them to everything else. So if you're treating the SCM you can do it many ways. You can do muscle energy, engage the barrier, ask the patient to isometrically move into the freedom and keep them going. But for this discussion, we're going to talk about the counterstrain for this point. So we're going to do counterstrain to the SCM. Since the SCM has two origins, it can have two different treatments. We're going to talk about the main treatment position. This position is AC7. So the clavicular head insertion on the medial third of the clavicle is where AC7 is located. The sternal head is where AC8 is located. In this discussion, we're going to talk about AC7. So what's the treatment position? Remember, counterstrain is always fold and hold. And to do that, you bring the origin and insertion closer together. So you do what the muscle can do. So you already know what the treatment setup is. You know that the muscle can flex, side bend toward, rotate away. So for counterstrain for the SCM, you're going to flex, side bend toward, rotate away. So this lecture was broken up into two different segments. We talked about how you can diagnose the cervical vertebra and that there's no Fryette's laws in this area. You have to follow a different chart. We talked about how you induce translation and how it relates to side bending. We did some practice questions, gave some examples of HVLA, and definitely some contraindications, and then we switched gears, talked about the sternocleidomastoid and related it to counterstrain. And that's OMM for the cervical spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Cranial]  
﻿The topic of cranial is all about understanding the motion of two bones in relation to one another. It's usually difficult for students because there's a lot of 3D spatial awareness. But what I've done in this lecture is broken down these complex 3D motions into 2D structures that you can easily identify. So to first go over it, here's a picture of the two bones that we're talking about from a side view. Here's where the sphenoid is, here's the occiput, and here is the SBS joint, or the sphenobasilar synchondrosis. This joint is what we're going to be naming all the dysfunctions of. From a top down view, here is where the sphenoid is, here's where the occiput is, and here is that SBS joint. Remember, the SBS joint is the articulation between the sphenoid and the occiput where all motion rotates around. So to start off with, we're going to talk about how you can palpate these motions using the vault hold. The vault hold is going to tell you where you are going to hold your fingers in order to palpate the motion. Your index finger will be at the greater wing of the sphenoid. Your middle finger will be located on the temporal bone in front of the ear. Your ring finger will also be located on the temporal bone in the mastoid area, and your little finger will be on the squamous portion of the occiput. The main two points for you to get the diagnosis will be the index finger and the little finger. The index finger is palpating the motion of the sphenoid, and the little finger is palpating the motion of the occiput. So now I'm going to draw out the SBS joint where the sphenobasilar synchondrosis is and how the sphenoid and occiput relate to one another from three views - a view from the side, a view top down, and a view from the posterior view. So throughout all of these drawings, we're going to have the sphenoid in red and the occiput in blue. For a top down view, you're going to see this, where red is sphenoid, blue is occiput. And from a posterior to anterior view, you'll see this, where the two wings of the sphenoid are both level. So the two primary motions of the SBS are going to be flexion and extension. During flexion, the sphenoid and the occiput rotate outward. Now recall from the sacrum video, we had mentioned craniosacral motion, along with nutation and counternutation. When the SBS goes into flexion, the sacrum is going to move into counternutation. The sacrum will be pulled back posterior. The way you can think of this is as if there is a line that attaches the occiput to the top of the sacrum. So when the occiput rotates outward, it's going to tug the sacrum back up with it and dip it into counternutation. When you go into flexion, you are going to have a short AP axis, a wide transverse axis, and your sacrum will counternutate. The next motion is extension. Extension is the motion that's going to happen after flexion. Extension will bring the sphenoid and the occiput back to neutral. So it's going to look like this. So the occiput will rotate back down and the sphenoid will rotate back down. So the sphenoid and occiput are already in flexion. They're going to make this rotational movement to return back to neutral, and that movement is extension. When they make this movement, it's also going to move the sacrum. Now you still have that string that's on the sacrum. When the occiput rotates back down into neutral, the sacrum will then dip into nutation forward. So during extension, you're going to have a long AP axis, a narrow transverse axis, and your sacrum will nutate. So what about the rest of the cranial bones? During flexion, all other paired cranial bones will externally rotate. During extension, all paired cranial bones will internally rotate. This motion is what causes your short and long AP axis and your wide and narrow transverse axis. So now we're going to talk about dysfunctional motion and some different diagnoses that you can have in the world of cranial. So our first one is going to be a torsion. So here's what a drawing will look like from the posterior view. You have your occiput, and then you have your sphenoid. The motion that's occurring here is a twisting motion along an AP axis. Now the twisting motion is going to be different for the sphenoid and the occiput. Imagine that this hand is for the sphenoid and this one is for the occiput. While one hand rotates to the left, the other hand will rotate to the right. So this is the motion of a torsion from the posterior view. So here, the sphenoid is rotating to the left, while the occiput is rotating to the right. This motion occurs around an AP axis. And the motion is opposite of one another. So how do you name this dysfunction? You're going to name it based on which wing of the sphenoid is more superior. So in this drawing the right wing is more superior, so you have a right torsion. The second diagnosis that we're going to go over is a side bending and rotation. For this dysfunction, we're going to have the occiput and the sphenoid from a posterior view, except this time they both rotate in the same direction. So they both rotate to the left or they both rotate to the right along an AP axis. But there's also a second motion that happens. What happens here is there's rotation about two vertical axes, where they both rotate in opposite directions. So the sphenoid is rotating counterclockwise while the occiput is rotating clockwise. You're going to name this dysfunction based on which direction the sphenoid is rotating. So the sphenoid is rotating to the right, so this is a right side bending and rotation dysfunction. We discussed the rotation around the AP axis and they both rotate in the same direction. The rotation along the two vertical axes are in opposite directions. So there are three axes that side bending and rotation dysfunctions occur around. There's the AP axis where both bones rotate in the same direction, and then two vertical AP axes where they both rotate in the opposite direction. The next three dysfunctions are going to be something that you see in trauma patients. So the first one is going to be a shear. In this dysfunction, one bone is going to be rotated higher than the other. So the sphenoid will be rotating superiorly, while the occiput is rotating inferiorly. To name the dysfunction, you name which direction the sphenoid is rotating. So the sphenoid is rotating up, so this is an up shear or a superior shear. There are two axes that the bones rotate around, and they are both horizontal. So imagine the two axes are here and here, and both bones are rotating around the axes. Both bones are rotating in the same direction. In this example, they're both rotating counterclockwise. So in this example, you have an up shear or a vertical shear. The next dysfunction is lateral, and here you have the sphenoid and the occiput moving laterally in two different directions, the sphenoid moving right, the occiput moving left. You're going to name the dysfunction based on the direction the sphenoid is moving. The sphenoid is moving to the right, so we're going to name this right lateral. The final dysfunction that you may see is a compression dysfunction. In this dysfunction, both bones are coming together. So at the SBS, they're both compressing, so a compression dysfunction. So what are the indications that you're going to need to see in order to assess the patient for a cranial dysfunction? It can really be just about anything. So if the patient comes in and he's just saying, I don't feel so great, I'm tired, I have a headache, whatever, you can assess for cranial dysfunctions. If you're going to treat cranial, you're treatment pattern will be indirect. So remember, for indirect treatments, you push into the freedom or what they can do, or into the diagnosis. So if I want to treat a right torsion, I'm going to push the bones further into right torsion. So it's an indirect technique. The way that you're going to do this technique is with your fingers still in the vault hold and by moving into that motion. Two other techniques that you need to know the names of are CV4 and the V-spread. So a CV4 treatment is going to increase the patient's CRI, or cranial rhythmic impulse. A normal CRI is 8 to 12 per minute. If you want to increase the CRI, perform the CV4. V-spread is going to help you release sutures. When you release the sutures, you're going to have more motion at whatever suture you're treating. So we went over how to represent all of these dysfunctions pictorially, but what are you going to palpate when you're palpating the patient's cranium? So you have your fingers in the vault hold. You're going to have your pointers on the greater wing of the sphenoid and your little fingers on the squamous portion of the occiput. During flexion, you're going to feel both hands move towards the patient's feet while your fingers spread apart. So normal flexion will look like this, and this is what you'll palpate. Extension is going to bring you back to neutral. So once you're in flexion, extension will feel like this. Your fingers are going to come back where they started and your pointer and pinkie are going to be come closer together. So flexion and extension. What about torsion? When you're palpating a torsion, you always want to name based off whatever wing of the sphenoid is more superior. When you're doing this palpation, a torsion will feel like this motion. You're going to name it based on which wing of the sphenoid is more superior, and which finger is palpating that? Your pointer finger is. So if we're going to name a right torsion, the right pointer finger will be higher than the left. So right torsion, left torsion. What about side bending and rotation? Exaggerate the flexion and extension motions, just do them backwards. So one hand will go into flexion and the other hand will exaggerate into extension. Going the other direction, it will look like this, where one hand goes into the flexion motion and the other hand comes back and into exaggerated extension. You're going to name the dysfunction based on which hand goes further into flexion. So this will be a left side bending and rotation. Shears, you fingers will move in this direction. This will be an up shear. Up shear will move like this. A lateral strain is the parallelogram head that you remember from class. So you're going to feel this motion, where the fingers move into a parallelogram. You're going to name it based on which direction your pointer fingers are both going. So a right lateral shear, left lateral shear. So if you remember the hand motions, as well as the pictures that we've drawn, you should be really prepared for any cranial that comes up on your exams or even in the clinic. And that is OMM cranial. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Fibular Head and Foot Arches]  
﻿In this second and final video of the lower extremity, we're going to go over fibular head mechanics, the arches of the foot and some final counterstrain points of the lower extremity. In order to talk about the fibular head, we first have to talk about the motions of the foot. So we're going to start off there. So foot motions. Just like you can supinate and pronate your hand, you can also supinate and pronate your foot. So for pronation, if we want to do that with our foot we're going to have to go into dorsiflexion, eversion, AB duction, abduction. So what do those motions do? They take the foot a little bit further away from midline. So remember, dorsiflexion is when you bring your toes upward. Eversion is when you tilt your foot outward, away from the body, and abduction is when you take it further away. So that is going to be pronation. When you make that motion with your foot, other bony landmarks are also going to move to accommodate. So some motion is going to be in the talus and also in the tibia. When you pronate your foot, your talus and your tibia are going to accommodate by externally rotating. Your talus will also accommodate by moving posteriorly. So that's pronation. Let's move into supination. Remember, supination for your upper extremity is when you kind of turn your hand as if you're trying to hold a bowl of soup. It's the same idea for your feet as well, so imagine you're trying to hold a bowl of soup with your feet. For supination, it's going to be the opposite of pronation. So you're going to plantar flex, invert your foot and AD duct your foot, adduction. Remember that plantar flexion is when you point your toes down, inversion is when you tilt your foot inward, and AD duction is when you bring it closer to the midline. So if you do that with both of your feet, you might have a better chance holding a bowl of soup. When you do this, your talus and your tibia are going to accommodate this motion. It's going to be in the opposite direction. So talus and tibia will internally rotate and your talus will move anteriorly. So now that you understand the motions of the foot, we can now move into fibular head mechanics. Now the fibular head is going to be one of the main topics of this lecture, so you need to know the motions of the foot in order to understand the motions of the fibular head. So when you have your foot in neutral, the fibular head will also be in neutral. It'll be running parallel with the tibia. When you dorsiflex your foot, your fibular head is going to move. So when I dorsiflex, the fibular head will move anterior and the distal portion of the fibula will move posterior. So when you dorsiflex, you're going to have an anterior fibular head. It's going to be the opposite when you plantar flex. Your fibular head is going to go in the other direction. So when you plantar flex, the distal portion of your fibula will move anterior, and your fibular head will move posterior. So when you plantar flex, your fibular head will move posteriorly. P-P. So what are you going to see in a patient that has some sort of fibular head dysfunction? They'll potentially have some decreased range of motion in their ankle, which is because the fibular head is not moving properly. This lack of movement is going to cause a lack of accommodation for ankle motion into supination and pronation. What you can also see is pain in the ankle region, but also pain in the knee region. So if you have a patient who comes in with ankle pain and knee pain, you can potentially think of the fibula as being dysfunctional. Even if they come in with simply knee pain, you can still think of the fibula. So how do we make the diagnosis? You're going to do what's called the spring test. You're going to have the patient sitting on the edge of the examination table. You're going to pinch the fibular head bilaterally, and then you're going to spring the fibular head anteriorly and posteriorly. When you're doing this, you're going to assess for range of motion on both sides, and whichever side doesn't want to move furthest into one direction, then that's how you're going to know which side is dysfunctional and how to name it. Remember, you always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So if on the right side you're doing the spring test, it goes easily into the anterior motion but it doesn't really like to go posterior compared to the other side, that means you have a right anterior fibular head. So to get the diagnosis, you do the spring test. So how are we going to treat this dysfunction? We're going to use muscle energy. So remember back all the way at the beginning when we were talking about how you do muscle energy. You passively move the patient into the restrictive barrier, then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do, which is also the name of the diagnosis. So we're going to use that in order to set up the treatment. So let's say that we have an anterior fibular head first. So if you have an anterior fibular head, that means that the foot is more than likely in some sort of dorsiflexion. If it's in dorsiflexion, that means that your foot is pronated. So this is the freedom. This is what the foot can do. If you're going to put it into the barrier, that means you're going to put it into supination. So to achieve the barrier for this treatment, you put the foot into supination. So then what motion do we instruct the patient to move into for their isometric force? Move into the freedom. So what can they do? They can dorsiflex, because you have an anterior head dysfunction. So you put them into pronation. So you remember all the steps. You need to have them do this three times, move further into the barrier, then at the end bring them passively back to neutral and then you rescreen. It's going to be the exact opposite for the other dysfunction. So if you have a posterior fibular head, you're going to engage the restrictive barrier, posterior fibular head, plantar flexion, it likes to go into supination, the barrier is pronation. So pronation barrier and move into the freedom, which is the diagnosis, which is plantar flexion. Do the treatment, bring them passively back to neutral, rescreen. So now we're going to transition to a topic that still comes up on exams but is kind of more anatomy based. But we can talk about it in the OMM sense if you can think about manipulating where exactly the bones are by pushing them. So we're going to talk about the arches of the foot. Now we came up with an advanced organizer for this. It's going to be Tetris pieces. So you're going to see what I mean as I'm drawing this out. There are three different arches that we need to talk about, the transverse, the medial and the lateral. So I'll start out with transverse and we'll draw our Tetris piece. So in the Tetris piece we're going to have three bones: navicular, cuneiforms, and the cuboid. These three bones are going to make up your transverse arch. So the next two arches are your medial and lateral. So these two arches have the exact same Tetris piece as the transverse arch. So we'll start with that. Navicular, cuneiforms and the cuboid. So the transverse arch has the entire Tetris piece. It has the navicular, the cuneiforms and the cuboid. The medial and lateral arches share the Tetris piece. So the medial arch has a navicular and the cuneiforms, while the lateral arch has the cuboid. Because they share the Tetris piece, we're going to add in some extra bones. Each arch is going to get some of the metatarsals and one additional bone. So the medial arch is going to have metatarsals 1 through 3 and the talus, while the lateral arch is going to have metatarsals 4 through 5 and the calcaneus. So going over it again, transverse arch, the entire Tetris piece. Medial and lateral arches share the Tetris piece while they both have some extra metatarsals and one extra bone of the foot. So now we're going to finish the lecture with some counterstrain. But to talk about that, we're going to go over some of the ligaments of the ankle. So this is going to be your fibula, this is going to be your talus, and this will be your calcaneus. So imagine that the toes are this way, so we'll draw in some extra toes going this way. So there are three ligaments that we need to go over. We have the anterior talofibular, the calcaneofibular, and the posterior talofibular. So the name of the ligament gives away where it's located. Anterior talofibular is on the anterior side, connects the talus to the fibula. Posterior, same reason, and calcaneofibular exact same. The reason I point these out is so that you can know where the attachment and the origin of the ligaments are. So this is the final time that we have any counterstrain points. A moment of silence for counterstrain points. So counterstrain is an indirect technique. You bring the two ends closer together to make it do what it can do. So you're already going to beat me to this. How are we going to do counterstrain? So these ligaments are all on the lateral side of the foot. So if we're going to treat the lateral ankle and we need to bring the two ends closer together, we're going to evert the foot. Now imagine that we're on the medial side of the ankle. You have some different ligaments and different muscles that attach in that area as well. Don't worry about the names, but since they all attach in the same area, you're just going to bring the two ends together. And to do that, you're going to invert. And then one final one, plantar fascia. So a common thing that you'll see on the exams is an individual has lower foot pain when they wake up in the morning. It takes them a little while to stretch out. They can feel it right on the bottom of their foot or closer to their calcaneus. They're trying to point you toward plantar fasciitis. So how are you going to treat it with counterstrain? Bring the two ends closer together. So you're going to flex the foot and collapse it, and then add some compression to try and bring the two ends of the plantar fascia closer together. So for plantar fascia, you will flex and compress the foot. So this was our final lecture on lower extremity. We went over the motions of the foot and how to relate that to the fibular head mechanics. We went over the arches of the foot and used our Tetris piece example, and we also talked about the ankle, the ligaments and our final discussion on counterstrain. And that's lower extremity part two. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Forearm]  
﻿This is our third and final lecture of the upper extremity. In the first lecture, we went over dysfunctions of the shoulder area. In the second one we talked about the sits muscles, and in this lecture we're going to talk about the carrying angle, the radial head and some counterstrain points that you'll notice in the forearm. So we're going to start off with the carrying angle. So what is the carrying angle? Imagine that you're standing up straight and there is a heavy weight on the ground or a pail of water or backpack or whatever. When you pick up that weight, the angle that your arm is located is going to be the carrying angle. So to draw this out and how we calculate the carrying angle, we're going to have a few different axes of motion. So you have your humerus, your radius and your ulna. So there's two axes that you use to calculate the carrying angle. You're going to use a humoral axis, which runs directly down the shaft of the humerus, and then you are going to use the forearm axis, which is going to run between the radius and the ulna back towards the elbow. The carrying angle is going to be this angle here. In men, this angle is typically smaller than in women. In men, the typical angle is 5. In women, the typical angle is about 10. Usually you have plus or minus two degrees. So why are we talking about the carrying angle? So you can have two different types of carrying angle extremes. You can have cubitus valgus and you can have cubitus varus. So when we go over cubitus valgus first, imagine that someone is carrying a big weight, and instead of having their arm straight, their arm is going to look like a big L. Cubitus valgus. So their elbow is going to be close to their body and their wrist is going to be a little bit further out. So this is what we call cubitus valgus. So writing that out, cubitus valgus looks like a big L and it has an L in the name of it. This carrying angle is going to be greater than 15 degrees, and there are two landmarks that you need to know where they're located with this carrying angle. Imagine you have your arm in the shape of an L and you notice where your ulna and where your wrist are deviated. Your ulna is AB ducted, it's further away from your body, and your wrist is pointed towards you, so it's AD ducted, adducted. So they're both opposite. Your ulna is abducted, and your wrist is adducted. So writing this out, you have an abducted ulna and an adducted wrist. So the first type of carrying angle extreme that you can have is cubitus valgus. So what's cubitus varus? It's going to be the opposite. So instead of having a bit L angle, you're going to be kind of cattywonkus like this, where your elbow is further out and your wrist is really close to your body. The main difference that you need to see here is that your ulna is now AD ducted, it's closer to you, it's adducted, and your wrist is now pointed away from your body, so it's abducted, AB ducted. So writing that whole thing out, we have cubitus varus. The carrying angle that you're looking for is less than 3 degrees. You're going to have an AD ducted ulna and an AB ducted wrist. Don't worry about being able to fix the angle right now. Really, you're going to be asked to diagnose the carrying angle and understand where the landmarks are for each diagnosis. So we're going to leave the carrying angle behind and we're going to start talking about the radial head. So the radial head is the head of the radial bone. So it moves when you are supinating and pronating your arm. When your arm goes into supination, your radial head goes anteriorly. When you pronate, your radial head goes posteriorly. So writing that out, pronate equals posterior, and supinate goes anterior. So remember, we always name a dysfunction based on what it can do. So when we go through these examples, think about where the radial head likes to go during motion. So imagine that you fall forward onto an outstretched hand. When you fall forward, you're going to pronate your hand to catch yourself. And when you pronate your hand, your radial head is already posterior. Well, imagine when you do that motion, you're then going to jam your radial head where it currently is. So it's going to get stuck posterior, so you're going to have a posterior radial head dysfunction. So writing out the example, fall forward, pronated catch and a posterior dysfunction. So what about an anterior radial head? It's going to be the exact opposite. Imagine you fall backward. You're still going to try and catch yourself with your hand, but your hand is going to be supinated. When you supinate your hand, your radial head is anterior and it's going to jam it further anterior. That's where it likes to go, that's the name of the diagnosis. So writing it out, fall backward, supinated catch, anterior dysfunction. So how do we make this diagnosis in a patient? What we're going to do is we're going to have the patient seated. We're going to have both of his arms flex at 90 degrees, and then we're going to passively assess pronation and supination. Passively pronate, then passively supinate. We're going to measure which one doesn't want to go in a certain direction in order to make our diagnosis. But remember, name the diagnosis on what it can do. So to make the diagnosis, you're going to passively move. So how are we going to treat these dysfunctions? We're going to use muscle energy for this, and the reason is it's easy to set up a barrier and it's easy to give an isometric contraction. Both treatments are very similar to one another, but the barrier that you engage and the isometric force direction are going to be opposite to one another. So remember, all the way back at the beginning when we talked about what does muscle energy mean? You passively engage the barrier. You ask the patient to then move into the freedom of what they can do, move further into the restrictive barrier and so on and so forth. Same concept, different barriers. So for a posterior dysfunction, what's the barrier going to be? It's what they cannot do. If it's a posterior dysfunction, they cannot supinate. So the barrier that you're going to engage is a supination barrier. Now in what direction are you going to ask the patient to isometrically move? What they can do, into the freedom. So they can pronate. So if it's a posterior dysfunction, your barrier is supination, your isometric force is into pronation. It's going to be backwards for supination. So if it's a supinated dysfunction, the barrier that you're going to engage is pronation, and the isometric force direction into the freedom will be supination. After your treatment, make sure that you bring the patient back to neutral and rescreen. So this is all for the treatment. Diagnosis, barrier, freedom. Diagnosis, barrier, freedom. So to finish out upper extremity, we're going to go over some common counterstrain points that you're going to see. And there are three big ones that we're going to go over. The first one is going to be the long head of the bicep. I bet I know what you're thinking. I already know how to do the treatment. I put them into the passive position, the position of ease. I bring the muscle ends together. Exactly right. So to do this treatment, we're going to have the patient flex, AB duct and internally rotate. These three motions together bring the attachment and origin closer together for your treatment. The next position that we're going to talk about is medial epicondylitis. So medial epicondylitis is located on your medial epicondyle. All the muscles that attach to this are your forearm flexors. This is also known as golfer's elbow. So if all the forearm flexors attach to that location, what do you think the counterstrain position is going to be? Flexion. You're going to shorten the muscles. So you're going to flex the forearm, pronate and AD duction. The final one that we're going to talk about is the opposite of medial epicondylitis. It's lateral epicondylitis. It is called tennis elbow. The way that you can think about this is all the extensors of the forearm attach to that spot. Your treatment setup is going to be the exact opposite of the flexors. So just extend everything. So we have lateral epicondylitis, and you're just going to do everything backwards. So you're going to extend, supinate and AB duct. So we went over the treatment positions, but make sure that you don't forget the exact steps that you have to follow for counterstrain. You find the tender point, you make it a ten out of ten on the pain scale, passively move them into the position. Make sure it's less than three on the pain scale. Hold for 90 seconds, passively return to neutral and rescreen. You got to know all of the positions but you also have to remember the steps. So in this lecture, we went over three broad topics. We went over the carrying angle, how to calculate the angle and the two different diagnoses you can have. We went over radial head, pronation and supination, and some common falls that you're going to be asked about along with the treatment positions. And finally wrapped up with some counterstrain. And that's OMM for the forearm. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Hip Area and Knee v3]  
﻿Now we're going to begin our discussion on the lower extremity. We've divided this lesson into two different sections. This first section is going to go over Spencer technique for the hip, the important muscle piriformis, the ligaments of the knee and everyone's favorite counterstrain. So, we're going to start off with Spencer technique for the hip. So just like the Spencer technique for the shoulder, there's going to be different barriers that you need to engage during different portions of your treatment. So, the mnemonic to remember these barriers is Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin. Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin. These are going to be the barriers that you need to engage during treatment by moving the lower extremity. So, what are these barriers? Flexion, extension, compression with circumduction, traction with circumduction, internal rotation, external rotation, abduction and adduction. So, remember to engage these barriers you're going to move the lower extremity into these barriers. If it helps you remember, each two steps are opposite of one another. So, flexion extension, compression traction, internal external rotation, abduction adduction. B comes before D an alphabet, so abduction first. So next we're going to talk about the piriformis. You're going to see this muscle a lot in the clinic, but also on your practice questions. So, we're going to make sure to spend some time talking about it here. So, the origin of the piriformis is the posterior side of the sacrum. The insertion is the greater tubercle of the femur. So, knowing the origin and insertion and how muscles work, you have an idea of how that muscle is going to affect the body. So, when the muscle contracts, it brings the origin and insertion closer together knowing where these two are [indiscernible] those anything will make, external rotation of the lower extremity. So, function is lower extremity external rotation. So, what about when it's dysfunctional? Remember a dysfunctional muscle is just going to stay hypertonic. It's going to stay contracted which will pull the origin and insertion closer together and keep them there. So, you already know that position. It's going to be lower extremity external rotation. So, in dysfunctional you're going to see a patient that has lower extremity external rotation. Now here's a clinical correlate that will definitely come up. Remember from anatomy the sciatic nerve comes out just below the piriformis muscle. So, when the muscle is dysfunctional and becomes hypertonic, it can start to impend into sciatic nerve leading to shooting burning pains down the patient's leg. The patient presents like that in your clinic or if you happen to see that on some practice questions, they may be trying to get you to think about the piriformis. So, to help you remember that, I'm going to put sciatic nerve. So, how are we going to treat the piriformis? There're many ways to treat all the muscles in the body as long as you remember the core concepts from the treatment modality lesson. So here we're going to discuss how to treat the piriformis using muscle energy. Now muscle energy if you remember back, how do you perform it? You put the patient into the barrier of what they can't do. You have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do repeat three to five times, back to neutral, rescreen. So, for muscle energy you need to engage the barrier. Now the barrier for the piriformis is what it can't do. So, when it's dysfunctional external rotation, so what it can't do is internal rotation. So internal rotation is the barrier. Then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do, and you already know what they can do, they can externally rotate. So lower extremity external rotation is the freedom. So now we're going to leave the piriformis and start talking about the ligaments of the knee. So, here's your femur. Here's your tibia and here's your fibula. Now this isn't an anatomy course. Don't get too bogged down trying to think of the exact origin and insertion, just get an idea of where these ligaments are, what side of the knee the patient may have pain and where you would palpate the structures? So, on the patient's medial side they're going to have the MCL or the Medial Collateral Ligament and the medial meniscus. So, when you palpate it on the medial side, it'll be on the medial side. So medial is the MCL and medial meniscus and what about the lateral side? On the lateral side you're going to palpate the LCL and the lateral meniscus. So lateral LCL and lateral meniscus. Now you have the ACL and the PCL. You can't palpate the structures from the anterior side because of the patella, so both of these structures will be palpable from the posterior side. So, the ACL attaches to the anterior portion of the tibia and the posterior portion of the femur and you'll feel it from the posterior side. The PCL attaches to the posterior side of the tibia and the anterior side of the femur. You'll still feel it from the posterior side. So now that you have a general idea of where on the knee these structures are and where the patient may have a tender point, we're going to talk about everyone's favorite counterstrain. Now I think at this part in the lecture series, we've been counterstrain to death, fold and hold treatment, bring the origin and insertion closer together, hold for 90 seconds, go through all those steps. So, this should be pretty easy for you. Now that you know where the structures are on the knee. So, if you have an MCL or medial meniscus tender point on the medial side of the knee you'll treat it with flexion adduction, an internal rotation. So, you're going to flex the patient's knee, adduct the tibia and bring it closer to the body and then you're going to internally rotate the tibia. All these motions will bring both ends of the MCL closer together for your counterstrain treatment position and we're going to compare that to the LCL and the lateral meniscus. You're going to feel this tender point on the lateral side and because it's on the opposite side of the MCL, the treatment position will be the opposite. So flexion abduction and external rotation. So, you're going to once again flex at the knee, abduct the tibia, which will abduct the fibula bringing both ends of the LCL closer together and you will add external rotation of the lower extremity to get them even closer. So next you have the ACL and the PCL. Now to treat these two with counterstrain, you're going to have to use the third osteopathic arm, which is basically anything that you have in the office to help you during treatment setup. This could be a pillow, a bunch of T-shirts, the foundation's textbook whatever you have on hand. So, to treat the ACL we're going to use a third osteopathic arm of a pillow and we're going to place it behind the femur, then we're going to push the tibia posterior. So now we're going to draw a picture so you can get an idea of how this treatment position would work. So, here's the femur from the lateral side, here's the tibia from the lateral side and here's the patella on the anterior portion of the knee. You have the ACL running from the anterior portion of the tibia to the posterior femur and you have the PCL posterior tibia going to the anterior femur. So, if you place a pillow behind the femur and then you push the tibia posteriorly, you're going to bring the two ends of the ACL closer together. That's going to be your counterstrain treatment position for the ACL. So, the PCL attaches in the opposite places of the ACL. So, what do you think the treatment position will be? The opposite. So, you're going to put the pillow behind the tibia and you're going to push the femur posterior. So, your pillow is going to go behind the tibia, you're going to push the femur posteriorly, that's going to bring both edges closer together, that's your counterstrain treatment point. So, the next two muscles we're going to compare together are the piriformis and the glutes. So, we already discussed the piriformis, the origin and insertion and what the muscle typically does, which is lower extremity external rotation. We talked about how to treat with muscle energy, but you can also treat it with counterstrain. The treatment position is going to be the position of these for the muscle, which as you'll recall will be external rotation. If you need to get the pain scale below 3 out of 10, you can add in slight abduction and slight flexion. So, comparing that to the glutes. The glutes are the primary hip extensors of your body. So, the position of ease of the glutes is going to be hip extension, countering treatment position, hip extension and if you need to readjust to get the pain below 3 out of 10, you can add abduction and you can also add external rotation. So, the final two we're going to have the PSOAS and the Iliacus. Now remember we already went over so PSOAS back in the lumbar lesson. So, if you recall this is the one where the tender point is two-thirds the distance between the ASIS and umbilicus. So, two-thirds, ASIS and umbilicus. So, what was the primary motion of the PSOAS? It was flexion, external rotation and slight side bending towards, so what do you think the counterstrain position will be? What the muscle can do? So, flexion, external rotation and side bending towards. Now the iliacus is pretty similar to the PSOAS in terms of function and where the tender point will be. The iliacus tender point is one-third the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus. So, one-third ASIS and umbilicus. Since the muscle movement is also pretty similar compared to the PSOAS the treatment position will also be pretty similar. So, it will be flexion, external rotation and instead of side bending towards, we're going to add abduction of the lower extremity. So, we went over a lot in this lesson. We talked about the Spencer technique for the hip and the mnemonic Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin to help you remember the barriers. The important muscle piriformis along with the sciatic nerve clinical correlate. The locations of all of the ligaments of the knee and where you would be able to palpate the structures as well as where the patient may have pain and we brought a lot back home were some counterstrain and that's OMM for the lower extremity part 1. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Hip Area and Knee]  
﻿Now we're going to talk about OMM for the lower extremity. This series is just going to be split into two videos. This first video, we're going to go over the Spencer technique for the hip, the important muscle piriformis, the ligaments of the knee, and of course, some counterstrain points. So we're going to start off with Spencer for the hip. So just like the Spencer technique for the shoulder, you're going to have multiple steps for the Spencer technique of the hip. So in order to memorize this, come up with another pneumonic that we can use. Felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So remember, felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So these letters represent the barriers that we are going to place the patient into for treatment. So the first one is flexion barrier, then you have extension, then you have compression with circumduction, then you have traction with circumduction, then you have internal rotation, external rotation, AB duction, and then AD duction. All of these motions that you can do with the lower extremity flexed in order to get the motion correct. Another way to look at this is if you notice, every two barriers are opposite of one another. Flexion extension, compression traction, internal external, AB duct AD duct. So remember, felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So now we're going to talk about the piriformis. This muscle comes up on just about every single OMM exam that I've ever taken. So we're going to spend some time to talk about it. So the piriformis origin is on the posterior side of the sacrum. The insertion is on the greater tubercle of the femur. So if we think about concepts in anatomy, what do you think the piriformis is going to do? It attaches on the sacrum, inserts at the greater trochanter. So if we think about the origin and insertion, we can get an idea of the motion that the piriformis does. When the muscle contracts, it brings both ends closer together, and to do that the lower extremity must externally rotate. So the piriformis causes lower extremity external rotation. So function is lower extremity external rotation. So what about when it's dysfunctional? So think about this. When the piriformis is dysfunctional, it's going to be hypertonic. It's going to be contracted and stuck in that position. So it's going to keep both ends of the muscle closer together. What does that mean? It means that the leg is externally rotated. So when it's dysfunctional, you're going to see an external rotation of the lower extremity. Now here's a clinical correlate that always pops up on exams. You have to remember anatomically that the sciatic nerve comes out right below the piriformis. If the piriformis is dysfunctional and hypertonic, it can begin to compress the sciatic nerve. And when that happens, the patient will have lower extremity paresthesias, potentially some burning and shooting pain. So if you see something like that in a clinic or on an exam, they might be trying to tell you to take a look at the piriformis and see if it's dysfunctional. So to keep that in your head I'm going to put sciatic nerve. So how are we going to treat this? There's a couple different ways to treat the piriformis, but the first one that we're going to go over is muscle energy. So thinking back to the beginning about how you do muscle energy, you put the muscle into the restrictive barrier where it cannot go. You have the patient flex into the freedom or where it can go. You do that multiple times, bring them back to neutral, rescreen. So the thing that you need to know for the piriformis is, where is the restrictive barrier and what motion do they need to do to go into the freedom? We already wrote it down. When it's dysfunctional, it can externally rotate. So what we're going to do to engage the barrier for muscle energy treatment is to internally rotate. So then what motion are we going to have the patient do isometrically in order to move into the freedom? We get them to do what the muscle can do, which is external rotation. So when treating with muscle energy, you always engage the restrictive barrier passively and then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom. Once that the treatment's over, you're going to bring the patient back to neutral and rescreen. So we're going to leave piriformis behind and we're going to begin to talk about some of the ligaments of the knee. And to do that, we're going to draw a picture. So this is going to be your femur, and this is going to represent your tibia. Your fibula will be on this side to show you that this is lateral and this is medial. So there are four big structures that we need to talk about that are located in the knee. The first structures are on the medial side of the knee, and that's going to be your MCL, your medial collateral ligament, and your medial meniscus. So they're going to be located medial meniscus, MCL. Don't worry about getting into the nitty gritty of what they attach to, where they are, what the function is. That's for your anatomy course. Just understand that they're located on the medial side of the knee and they help with knee stability. So next, the lateral side of the knee, we're going to see the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus. So it's just going to be on the opposite side. So you have the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus. Two more ligaments, and both are going to be noticed from the posterior side. You have the anterior collateral ligament, which attaches to the anterior side of the tibia and the posterior side of the femur. You also have the posterior collateral ligament. The posterior collateral ligament attaches to the posterior side of the tibia and the anterior side of the femur. The reasons that we're going over these ligaments is so that you can get an idea of some counterstrain treatments of these ligaments. So if the patient is having pain in their medial knee and you find a tender point there, you'll probably want to treat the MCL. Lateral side, you're going to think about the LCL, and if you're palpating on the posterior side of the knee, you're going to have to think about the ACL and the PCL. So we're going to go ahead and discuss what the counterstrain positions are for these ligaments and some other important muscles of the lower extremity. So counterstrain. You already know how to do this treatment. I think that we've beaten it to death. It's indirect. You bring the two ends of the muscle closer together. You fold and hold. It's that simple. So if you have a tender point located on the medial side of the knee, you need to think about the MCL and the medial meniscus. If you're going to bring the two ends of the MCL together, you're going to flex, AD duct and internally rotate. So you're going to flex the knee joint, you're going to AD duct the tibia, so bring it closer to the body, which will then bring the tibia closer to the femur on the medial side, and then you will internally rotate the tibia. That's going to bring the two ends of the MCL closer together for your treatment position. We're going to compare that to the LCL and the lateral meniscus. They're located on the lateral side of the knee, so you're going to have to do the opposite that you would for the MCL. You're still going to flex, but you're going to AB duct and externally rotate. So you're going to flex the knee joint, AB duct the tibia away from the body, which will bring it closer to the femur on the lateral side, and then you're going to externally rotate the tibia to bring the two ends of the LCL closer together. So now we're going to compare those to the posterior tender points. On the posterior side, you'll have the ACL and the PCL. So for these two treatments, we're going to have to bring a friend to the party. We're going to have to use what we call the third osteopathic arm. Basically, whatever you have laying around to help you with the treatment. So in this one, we're going to use a pillow as an example. So for the ACL, you need to bring this anterior attachment on the tibia and the posterior attachment on the femur closer together. And the way that you're going to do that is place a pillow on the posterior side of the femur and then posteriorly push the tibia. So imagine this. You have the patient laying on their back. You have a pillow underneath the femur and you are pushing down on the tibia towards the table. That's going to push the tibia posteriorly, which is going to push this attachment closer to the attachment on the femur. The PCL treatment position is the opposite. So we're going to place the pillow under the tibia and we are going to push posteriorly on the femur. This motion will then bring both ends of the PCL closer together. So the next two that we're going to compare, we're going to talk about the piriformis and the glutes. So we already talked about one way to treat the piriformis, which could be muscle energy. If you find a tender point and you want to treat it with counterstrain, you just have to put it into the position of ease or what it can do, which we already discussed. The piriformis externally rotates, so you're going to externally rotate the lower extremity to do the counterstrain position. So for piriformis, your primary motion is going to be externally rotating. If you need to adjust slightly to make sure that you get below three on the pain scale, you can add slight AB duction and slight flexion. What about the glutes? So the glutes are primarily extensors of the hip and the lower extremity. So if you're going to put it into the treatment position that it usually goes in when it's contracted, it's extension. So the treatment position is going to be extension. The rest of the position, if you need to adjust to make sure that you get below three on that pain scale, is the exact same as the piriformis. Externally rotate and AB duction. Primary motion, extension. So two more counterstrain points that we're going to go over. The first one is going to be the psoas muscle, and the second one is going to be iliacus. Now if you remember, we already went over the psoas muscle earlier in the video series. This point is located two-thirds of the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus. It's primarily a hip flexor and it causes side bending towards the dysfunctional side. So what do you think the treatment position is to bring both ends together? Flexion and side bending towards. So just as a reminder, the psoas counterstrain point is two-thirds the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus, and the treatment position is going to be flexion, external rotation and side bending towards the dysfunction. So we're going to compare that to iliacus. The tender point for iliacus is going to be located one-third the distance from the ASIS to the umbilicus. The motion of the iliacus is very similar to that of the psoas. So the treatment position is going to be very similar to the psoas as well. So for this, we're going to remember that it's one-third the distance from the ASIS to the umbilicus, and the treatment position is going to include flexion, external rotation and instead of side bending towards, you're going to AB duct the lower extremity from the side of dysfunction. So in this lecture we went over a lot. We went over the Spencer technique for the hip and the pneumonic "felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin." We went over the always important piriformis muscle, some of the major structures of the knee, and we related that to how to use it, counterstrain points, talked about counterstrain points for piriformis and glutes, psoas and iliacus. That's OMM for the lower extremity, part one. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Innominate Dysfunctions v2]  
﻿Being able to diagnose the innominates should be pretty easy when compared to being able to diagnose the sacrum. You're still going to have to do an exam to figure out the laterality of the dysfunction and you still need to palpate some landmarks but being able to visualize emotions are going to be significantly easier than the sacrum. So, to start off, you have to figure out the laterality of the dysfunction. The way that you do that is by performing the standing flexion test. So, this test is exactly the same as a seated flexion test for the sacrum except instead of having the patient seated, you're going to have the patient standing. So you're going to have the patient stand, hook both of your thumbs underneath the patient's PSIS and as they flex forward, you're going to assess which thumb moves first, farthest or fastest, whichever thumb does that that's the side of the dysfunction and that's what you're going to name the dysfunction based off. So, there are two different tests that you can do for laterality. You can either do the standing flexion test or you can do the ASIS compression test. Now I put or because you don't have to do both exams. You only have to do one. You can choose whichever one you would like to do, but on a practice question, they may only give you the findings for the compression test and you'll need to know that means the same thing as a standing flexion test. The way to do this test, you have the patient lying supine on the table, you're going to place both of your hands on the patient innominates and you're going to push posteriorly, whichever side doesn't move easy or whichever side gives you a hardened feel is a side of the dysfunction. So, if it's dysfunctional on the right, it's going to be very difficult to compress down. So, once you figure out the laterality, you need to palpate some landmarks. The landmarks that you need to palpate are going to be the ASIS, the PSIS and the pubic tubercle. So, the ASIS is the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine. That's the bony landmark on the anterior surface of the innominates. The PSIS is the Posterior Superior Iliac Spine located on the posterior side of the Innominate. The PT is the Pubic Tubercle, you're going to palpate that on the anterior side of the abdomen going down low near the pubic area. So, when you palpate these findings, it's going to give you an idea of motion that the innominates are performing. The ASIS findings can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. Your PSIS findings can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. And your pubic tubercle findings can either be superior, or inferior. So superior or inferior to what? You're going to be comparing these landmarks bilaterally to one another. So, you're going to be comparing the right ASIS to the left ASIS. For example, if the right ASIS is superior, that means it's higher up than the left ASIS. Now there are three different dysfunctions that you can have for the innominates. You can either have a rotation, a shear, or you can have a flare. So, the first type of dysfunction is a rotation. These are really simple to visualize. Imagine that you are palpating the patient's sacrum and you're looking from the posterior side a rotation is simply the innominate rotating. It can either be an anterior rotation, where it goes forward or it can be a posterior rotation, where it goes backward. So, innominate anterior-posterior rotation. So, what are your landmark findings going to be for these diagnoses? We're going to look at the ASIS, the PSIS, we are also going to take a look at leg length, the cause and some treatments. So, for an anterior rotation, your ASIS will be inferior on the side of the dysfunction, your PSIS will be superior on the side of the dysfunction and that will be an anterior rotation. Now when you anteriorly rotate the inanimate, it's going to push the rest of the anatomy downward thus creating a long leg for the patient. So, if the patient has an anterior rotation, they may have a long leg on presentation. So, what's one cause of an anterior innominate rotation? Hypertonic muscles, so the muscle that attaches to the anterior portion of the innominates is your quads. When your quads become hypertonic, it can pull the anterior portion of the pelvis forward thus creating an anterior rotation. So, if you have dysfunctional quads, you may have an anterior rotation. Now the way that you're going to treat this if you want to target a muscle for muscle energy, you're going to work on a muscle that attaches to the posterior side to help pull the innominate back in a neutral. That muscle is going to be your hamstrings. So, if you want to treat an interior rotation with muscle energy, you'll target the hamstrings. Now a posterior rotation is basically the exact opposite of an anterior. So, the ASIS on the side of the dysfunction will be superior. The PSIS on the side of the dysfunction will be inferior. With a posterior rotation the anatomy will be pulled upward thus creating a short leg and it's going to be the opposite cause and treatment muscles for the rotation. So, one muscle that will cause a posterior rotation is the hamstrings and one muscle that you can use to treat a posterior rotation is the quads. So, the next dysfunctions are going to be the shear dysfunctions. You can have an up-shear, a down-sheer, a pubic up-shear and a pubic down-shear. The landmarks that you're going to be palpating are the ASIS, PSIS, the pubic tubercle and we're going to mention the leg length again. So, what's an up-shear and a down-shear? If you're holding the patient's innominates, an up-shear is just going up up-shear down-shear down, that's it. So, your landmark findings for an up-shear everything's going to be up. So, you're going to have a superior ASIS on the side of the dysfunction, superior PSIS and a superior pubic tubercle. Now imagine if you have an up-shear it's going to pull all the anatomy upward that's going to cause a short leg on the side of the dysfunction, so short. Down-shear going down is going to be the opposite. So, your findings will be the opposite. ASIS on the side of the dysfunction will be down, PSIS will be down and the pubic tubercle will also be down. If you're pushing the anatomy downward for a shear, the anatomy will go down and you'll have a long leg. So, what about a pubic up-shear and down-shear? It's little bit interesting for these the only finding that you're going to have is on the pubic tubercle. So, you're not going to have any dysfunctional locations for ASIS or PSIS, but your pubic tubercle will be superior on a pubic up-shear. On a pubic down-shear, no ASIS or PSIS findings, but your pubic tubercle will be inferior on the side of the dysfunction. So, the final type of dysfunction for the innominates are flares. You can either have an in-flare or an out-flare. Now an in-flare or an out-flare basically means that the innominate is curled inward or outward. So, an in-flare looking from the top down, the ASIS will curl medially. For an out-flare the ASIS will curl laterally. So, your landmark findings will be your ASIS and your PSIS. For an in-flare it's going to be medial for the ASIS and the PSIS you'll either have no findings or will be lateral. For an out-flare your ASIS will be lateral and your PSIS will either have no findings or will be medial. So, let's go over some practice questions to really hammer this back home. So, for the first one, you're going to have a positive standing flexion test on the right, an ASIS inferior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. So, you have two options. You can either have a memory of all of the different findings or you can use the cowabunga hands. cowabunga hand is just a visual representation of the inanimate motion, where your thumbs will represent your PSIS findings and your pinkies will be the ASIS findings. So, your findings are a right standing flexion test being positive, the right ASIS being inferior on the right side and to show that you can rotate your hand forward. This also has your PSIS being superior on the right, which is also a finding. So now that you're in this motion, you can really easily tell that you have a right anterior rotation, which is your diagnosis. So right anterior rotation. So, question 2. You have a compression test that's positive on the left, an ASIS that's inferior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. Now remember, you need to have the landmark findings on the side of the dysfunction. So, when you're doing the cowabunga hands or your writing it out, you need to make sure that you can flip your findings to the other side. For example, if the right ASIS is superior, that's the same thing as saying that the left ASIS is inferior. So, when you're doing the cowabunga hands for this question, the compression test being positive on the left tells you that the left side is dysfunctional. The right ASIS is inferior. So, you can rotate your right hand to show this and you're right PSIS is superior, because you need to know the findings of the dysfunctional side, which is the left side, you need to rotate your right hand back to neutral and rotate your left hand the same amount. This will now show that the findings on the right side are in neutral and the left side is dysfunctional. This now shows you that you have a left posterior innominate rotation, which is the correct answer. So left posterior rotation. So, question 3. You have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right. An ASIS that's superior on the right and a PSIS that's also superior on the right. So cowabunga hands, right hand dysfunctional, right ASIS and PSIS are both superior. So, this shows you that you have a right up- shear. So right up-shear. Next question, you have a positive compression test on the left. An ASIS that's superior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. cowabunga hands, right ASIS and PSIS are both superior, but the dysfunctions on the left side because of the left compression test being positive. So, this will easily show you that you have a left down-shear, because the left side is now down. So, you have a left down-shear. Question 5, you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right and an ASIS that is medial on the right. PSIS you have no findings. So cowabunga hands, right ASIS is now more medial and this will show you a right in-flare, you're curling inward. So, you have a right in-flare and for the final question, you have a compression test that's positive on the left. You have an ASIS that's equal on both sides, PSIS that's equal on both sides and a pubic tubercle that's superior on the right and you can't really use the cowabunga hands for a pubic shear, but these are pretty easy to find out. ASIS and PSIS you have no findings. So pubic tubercle is going to be what you base the diagnosis on. Pubic tubercle is superior on the right, but the compression test is positive on the left. So, the left side is dysfunctional, because the right side is higher, that means that the left side is lower, which means that you have a left pubic down-shear. So, we went over how to diagnose the innominates in this lecture. The first step is to either perform the standing flexion test or ASIS compression test to find which side is dysfunctional, you need to palpate your landmarks, you need to figure out if it's a rotation, shear or flare dysfunction and we went over some practice questions to make sure that you got it and that's OMM for the innominates. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Innominate Dysfunctions]  
﻿Being able to diagnose the innominates is pretty simple when you compare it to being able to diagnose the sacrum. You only need to know where the landmarks are in relation to one another to get the question correct. In this lecture, I'm going to walk you through how to get the correct diagnosis based on where the landmarks are. We're going to use a simple hand gesture to get the correct diagnosis. Then at the very end I'm going to include a flow chart for people that like flow charts. So if you take a look at the picture, on the anterior side of the innominate you have the anterior superior iliac spine or the ASIS. On the posterior side of the innominate, you have the posterior superior iliac spine, or the PSIS. Back on the anterior portion of the innominate, you have the public tubercle. You're going to use these three landmarks in order to get your innominate diagnosis. So we're going to use those landmarks to get the correct diagnosis for the innominates. So the first thing that you need is the standing flexion test. Now the standing flexion test is basically the same test as the seated flexion test, except instead of having the patient seated, they're going to be standing up. So don't get confused between the seated flexion test and the standing flexion test. The seated flexion test is only for the sacrum. The standing flexion test is for the innominates. So what we're going to do is have the patient standing. We're going to hook our thumbs below the PSIS and have the patient bend forward into flexion. As they go into flexion, one of our thumbs is either going to move first, furthest or fastest. Whichever side does that is going to be your positive side. That's going to be the side of dysfunction, and that's what you're going to name the diagnosis from. A test that's similar to the standing flexion test is called the ASIS compression test. This test tells you the same thing as the standing flexion test. It just says which side is positive. The way you perform this test is you have the patient laying on their back, supine, and you take both hands and you push posteriorly on the ASIS. Whichever side is more mobile is going to be the positive side, the positive compression test. You can compress it more. So then back to landmark anatomy for what you need to make the diagnosis. You have the ASIS, and there are four different findings that you can have for the ASIS. It can either be superior, it can be inferior, or it can be medial or lateral. All of these findings are in relation to the ASIS on the other innominate bone. So if the ASIS on the right side is superior, that means that the ASIS on the left side is inferior. Now the next landmark is the PSIS, and you can have the exact same findings for that. It can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. So these are once again in relation to the other innominate PSIS. So if the PSIS on the left is inferior, that means that the PSIS on the right is superior. The last landmark that you have is the pubic tubercle. The pubic tubercle can either be superior or inferior in relation to the other. So if one is inferior, the other is superior. So there are three different types of dysfunctions that you can have for the innominates. You can have rotations, shears and flares. So we're going to go over rotations first. The rotational dysfunction means that one of the innominates is rotated further than the other. You can either have an anterior rotation, meaning that it tips interiorly, or you can have a posterior rotation, meaning that it tips posteriorly in relation to the other. So if you have an anterior rotation, you're going to have these landmark findings. Your ASIS is going to be inferior on the side of the standing flexion test. Your PSIS is going to be superior on the side of the standing flexion test. When you have an anterior rotation, you are also going to have a longer leg on that side. So think about this anatomically. If the innominate is rotated anteriorly, you are pushing the rest of the bones downward, so you're creating a long leg. So what's one item that can cause this dysfunction? You can have hypertonic quads. So think about the anatomically. Your quads are on the anterior portion of your thigh. They attach to the anterior portion of your innominate. If they're hypertonic, they're going to yank down the rest of the innominate, causing a forward bending or an anterior rotation. So then how do you treat it? You're going to do the opposite. So what are the antagonist muscles to the quads? You have the hamstrings. So the hamstrings are located on the posterior side of the innominate. If you need to pull the rest of the innominate back into posterior rotation, you're going to treat the hamstrings with muscle energy. You're going to activate the hamstrings, pull that anteriorly rotated innominate back posterior. So you're going to treat with the hamstrings. The quads can cause an anterior rotation, you're going to fix it with the hamstrings. So now you have a posterior rotation. Basically the exact opposite of an anterior rotation, so you're ASIS is going to be superior on the side of the standing flexion test, your PSIS is going to be inferior on the side of the standing flexion test. You're going to have a short leg. It can be caused by the hamstrings and you can treat it with the quads. It's the exact opposite of the anterior rotation. So you have anterior and you have posterior. So I'm going to leave a gap here so we can come into some practice questions a little later on. But the next type of dysfunction that you can have is a shear. Now a shear is basically where one of the innominates is located either superiorly or inferiorly compared to the other side. So you can have a superior shear or an up shear, or you can have a down shear or an inferior shear. So what are your findings going to be for those? So for an up shear, you're going to have an ASIS that is superior on the side of the standing flexion test. You're going to have a PSIS that is also superior on the side of the standing flexion test. And you may even have finding of the pubic tubercle, which would also be superior on the same side as the standing flexion test. So how do we relate this to the leg? Imagine that you have an innominate that's up higher. It's going to pull the rest of the bones with it, so you can imagine that you're going to have a short leg on that side. So short leg. So if you have an up shear, that means that you can also have a down shear. In a down shear, the findings are exactly the opposite as an up shear. So you have an ASIS that is inferior on the side of the positive standing flexion test. PSIS that's also inferior, and a pubic tubercle that is also inferior. The leg length is going to be long. So imagine that the bones are being moved downward, you're going to have a long leg. There are two other types of shears that you can have. You can have a pubic up shear and you can have a pubic down shear. So you can have two other types of shears. You can have a pubic up shear and a pubic down shear. So these findings are very easy to point out. Your pubic tubercle on a pubic up shear will be superior. On a pubic down shear, your pubic tubercle will be inferior. But what about ASIS and PSIS? They're not going to have any landmark findings. So it's only going to be the pubic tubercle that has something. Same thing with a down shear. ASIS, PSIS nothing. Pubic tubercle will be down for a down shear on the side of dysfunction. And the last type of dysfunction that you can have in the innominates is a flare. There are two types. You can either have an in flare or an out flare. That means that one innominate bone is either tilted more inward as an in flare or tilted more outward as an out flare. So for these findings, in flare, your ASIS is going to be medial on the side of dysfunction, and your PSIS will either have no findings at all or will be lateral. And for an out flare, on the theme of being opposite, it's going to be the exact opposite. So you have an out flare, your ASIS is going to be lateral on the same side as your standing flexion test being positive, and your PSIS is either not going to have any findings or it's going to be more medial. So now I have all the findings. How am I going to be able to use this to get the diagnosis without memorizing all these tiny points? This is where the cowabunga hand is going to come in handy. So let's go ahead and write down a practice question. So for number one, we're going to have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right. An ASIS that is inferior on the right, and a PSIS that is superior on the right. So this is where your cowabunga hands are going to come into play. You hold them directly in front of you. Your thumbs are going to be the PSIS and your pinkies will be the ASIS. So what you're going to do is you're going to use the anatomic findings in order to get the correct diagnosis. So for these dysfunctions, remember that you always name the side of the standing flexion test for your diagnosis. So all of your diagnostic findings need to be on that side in order to get the cowabunga hands to work properly. So in this example, the standing flexion test is positive on the right side. The ASIS is located inferiorly on the right compared to the left. So I'm just going to twist my hand forward, so now the pinkie is lower than the other pinkie. The PSIS on the right side is superior on the right, more superior than the PSIS is on the left, which is still where I'm holding my hand. So if I'm looking at this, I can already tell that the right innominate is anteriorly rotated. So the answer is right anterior rotation. So then the second question. Let's say that you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the left, an ASIS that's inferior on the right and a PSIS that is superior on the right. So I just use my cowabunga hands once again. You have a positive standing flexion test on the left. So you're going to name everything based on the left side, which is the abnormal side. On the right you have an inferior ASIS but a superior PSIS. Now the findings are on the other side than the standing flexion test. The standing flexion test is the dysfunction side and the abnormal side, so you have to reverse it. So you move your fingers back into the regular anatomic position, so that now my right side, which is normal, is back in the normal plane and the left side is now dysfunctional. So now when I'm looking at my hand, I can tell that my left side has rotated posteriorly. So the answer is a left posterior rotation. So the next practice question. You have a compression test that's positive on the left and an ASIS that is inferior on the right and a PSIS that is inferior on the left. So remember, the compression test is the same thing as a standing flexion test. This just tells you that your findings are abnormal on the left side. So you need to relate all of the findings back to the left innominate. So your ASIS is inferior on the right side, so you rotate your right hand downward to get your pinkie inferior. The PSIS is inferior on the left side, so you rotate your hand left. So to get the diagnosis, you have to bring your right hand back to neutral because the left side is dysfunctional. So now you have your hands like this, you can tell that your left hand is posteriorly rotated. So you have a left posterior rotation. So let's do some practice questions for shears. So the first question, your standing flexion test is positive on the right. Your ASIS is superior on the right, and your PSIS is superior on the right. So if you're doing your cowabunga hands once again, you have to make sure that all of your findings are on the side of dysfunction, which for this example is going to be for the right. So now using the cowabunga hands, you have your standing flexion test that's positive on the right, which means that all of your diagnostic findings will be on this side. Your ASIS is superior on the right, and your PSIS is also superior on the right. So using this motion, you can tell that the right side is up. So you have a right up shear. Right up shear. Next question, standing flexion test positive on the right. ASIS is superior on the left, PSIS is superior on the left. So using your hands, the right side is dysfunctional. Left ASIS is up, left PSIS is up. Your findings are on the right side, so the right is dysfunctional. If you're looking at it, the right is now lower than the left. The answer is a right down shear. The final shear practice question, you have an ASIS compression test that's positive on the left. You have a pubic tubercle that is superior on the right. You have an ASIS finding of being normal and a PSIS finding of being normal. You can't really use the cowabunga hands for a pubic up shear or down shear. Just memorize it if the pubic tubercle is up and everything's normal, it's pubic up shear. If it's down, pubic down shear. So for this one, you've got a pubic up shear. So now some questions for a flare. You have the standing flexion test that's positive on the right, and you have an ASIS that is medial on the right. So cowabunga hands. Positive on the right side. You're right ASIS is more medial. So when you're doing this motion, you can tell that your right side is going inward, so this is an in flare on the right. So a right in flare. So the standing flexion test is going to be positive on the left and your ASIS is going to be medial on the right. Back to using your hands. The left side is dysfunctional. The right ASIS is located more medial. But you have to bring it back out to neutral so that it makes sense. So when you bring it to neutral, you're going to show that now the left side is an out flare. So bringing it back into neutral. So a left out flare. So if the cowabunga hands made sense to you then you don't really have to worry about anything else and the lecture's over. But if you're the type of person that likes a flow chart and just wants to be able to take the points that are given to you and plug it in somewhere to get the answer, we're going to do a quick flow chart for that. So in order to do that, so the first thing that you're going to do is compare the direction of the ASIS and PSIS on the same side as one another. So your ASIS can either be superior or inferior, and your PSIS can be superior or inferior. If you've noticed, for shears, the ASIS and PSIS are both superior or, for a down shear, the ASIS and PSIS are both going inferiorly on the same side. If you have a rotation that's anterior, the ASIS and PSIS are both located on the same side but pointing in opposite directions. For posterior rotation, the ASIS and PSIS are pointing in different directions but on the same side. So if we're going to use that for our flow chart, you're going to assess which direction the ASIS and PSIS are both pointing on the same side. So if they are both pointing superior or both pointing inferior on the same side, you're going to have a shear. Now if on the same side the ASIS and PSIS are pointed in opposite directions, that's going to tell you that you have some sort of a rotation dysfunction. So the next thing that you're going to do is compare the standing flexion test and the side of the superior ASIS. So if you're on the shear side, you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the same side that the ASIS is superior, you're going to have an up shear. If it's located on opposite sides, so let's say the standing flexion test is positive on the left but the superior ASIS is located on the right, that means that you're going to have a down shear. So now looking back at rotations, you're going to do the same next step. You're going to compare the standing flexion test versus the side of the superior ASIS. If the standing flexion test is positive on the same side as the superior ASIS, you're going to have a posterior rotation. If the side of the superior ASIS is on the opposite of the side of the positive standing flexion test, you're going to have an anterior rotation. So we went over two different methods of diagnosing the innominates during this lecture. We went over the cowabunga hands and we went over the chart. The only other thing that you need to do is assess which side the standing flexion test is positive, the ASIS location, the PSIS location, and the pubic tubercle location. And that's how you diagnose the innominates. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to Counterstrain]  
﻿This section is difficult and it's not very fun to learn. It's called counterstrain. The treatment of counterstrain tender points is pretty simple, but knowing the hundreds of different positions and knowing the exact setup for everything gets pretty complicated and pretty convoluted. So in this lecture, I'm going to teach you the high yield stuff that you have to know to get the questions correct using an advanced organizer, and explain to you that maybe you don't necessarily need to remember all the spots if you remember just to fold and hold. So let's go ahead and start with tender point. So a tender point is what you're going to be treating with counterstrain. A tender point is a hypertonic portion of muscle that is tender when you poke it. It doesn't radiate, it's a tender point. So hypertonic. Now how do you get a tender point to treat? What happens is you stretch a muscle too fast. An example of this would be you're in a car, you're at a red light, you get rear ended from behind. And when that happens, your neck extends very quickly and you get the whiplash motion. All the muscles in the front side of your neck are stretching way too fast than what they usually do. This is going to send a signal to your muscle spindle fibers. They're stretching too fast, they're going to get injured if they keep stretching this fast. So there is a reflex arc that says, slow down, contract the muscle. And when that happens, your muscle is then going to contract forcefully. So in our whiplash example, you get hit from behind, extend your neck in the whiplash, muscle spindle fibers get activated, tell you to flex your neck forcefully. And now, this is where the tender point will be, the anterior cervical area. Muscles are too contracted. So how do we treat this? When you're doing the treatment, it's very important to follow every single step exactly the same. What they will test you on in exam is making sure that you're following the steps exactly how they should be. So any counterstrain point, you have to treat it the same. So as we mentioned in the previous lecture, counterstrain is an indirect treatment, meaning that you put it into the freedom, you put it into the position of ease. So in our whiplash example, if the muscles on the anterior side of the neck are flexed and contracted, that means it is easy for them to flex but it's very difficult to go back into extension. So if I put it into flexion or into the freedom, that's indirect. So indirect and passive. And again, passive means that the patient does not participate in the treatment. The practitioner is moving them for themselves. So then what? You need to find the tender point and then you need to poke it and make the pain scale. So you find the tender point on the front of the patient's neck, you push on it and you ask them, how painful is that? And they're going to tell you it hurts ten out of ten, whatever. Whatever they say, you need to tell the patient that during the treatment, that pain that you're feeling right now is going to be considered a ten out of ten. So the next part is to passively move the patient into the treatment position. Now that you're in this position, you're going to poke the tender point again, and you're going to ask how painful is it? And they're going to tell you it's decreased. You ask where it is on the pain scale, and if they said it is three or less, you know that you're in the correct position for treatment. If they say anything other than three or less, you need to readjust your position to make sure the pain is less than three. Once you're here, you need to hold this position for 90 seconds. Once you hold for 90 seconds, then you can return the patient back to neutral. Once they're back in neutral, you continue to poke on the area and ask how is it now? Is it still painful? So you're rescreening to see if your treatment worked. An important part of this treatment is to know where you place your finger and when to lift it up. So once you find the tender point, you poke on the point. You keep your finger on the tender point. Once they give you the pain scale, you keep your finger on the point but you release pressure, so you're just monitoring. Move them to passive, reassess pain by adding pressure and poking on it, keep the finger on the point to monitor, hold for 90 seconds, passive to neutral, and then you can rescreen by poking on it. During the entire treatment, you never lift up your finger. You just adjust the pressure that you're putting on it. So now that you know the steps to treatment, we're going to go over some of the high yield points for you to know in the cervical spine, thoracic, lumbar and ribs. So you have anterior and posterior points. Anterior cervical, anterior thoracic, anterior lumbar and anterior ribs. And the organizer that we're going to use is going to be SARA. We're going to get really familiar with SARA during this talk. So we're going to write out SR for all the spots. Now calling back to the previous lectures, S and R mean side bending and rotation. All that we need to fill in is a directionality for each treatment point. So like I said, we're going to get very familiar with SARA. So any of the anterior cervical points, you're going to side bend away and rotate away. For the thoracic spine, it's going to be a little bit different. So you're going to rotate away but you're going to side bend towards. For anterior lumbar, you take the thoracic and you flip it. So you got side bend away and rotate towards. And then you got ribs. Ribs are different. They're not part of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. So they're going to be different than SARA. They're going to be side bend toward, rotate toward. Now what does toward and away mean? Each of these points can be located midline or lateral. When you're treating the lateral points on the right side and you want to side bend away, rotate away, you're going to side bend to the left and rotate to the left. If you want to side bend and rotate toward the right, side bend toward the right, rotate toward the right. That's treatment position. So the last component is the flexion and extension. Like I said earlier, fold and hold is going to be the easy way to remember all these. And since this is all anterior, how do you fold up the front? You go into flexion. So these are the basic anterior points for you to know. Now you need to learn the posterior. So you have posterior cervical, posterior thoracic, posterior lumbar and posterior ribs. For the posterior points, it's important to delineate between midline and lateral points. So cervical, you have a midline point and a lateral point. For thoracic you have a midline and lateral. We'll go over midline in a second. So let's just worry about lateral. For lumbar, you have a midline and a lateral, and for ribs you don't have midline or lateral. So now going back to our SARA pneumonic, she really helps us out a lot for the posterior side, because all of them are going to be side bend away, rotate away. The final portion is flexion or extension. So if it's in the back and you want to fold and hold those back muscles, you're going to extend. Now just like the anterior points and ribs being very different, just like that for posterior. The posterior point is going to be very different. So instead of extension, you're going to go into flexion. So these are all the normal points for the cervical spine, thoracic, lumbar and for the ribs of the anterior and posterior sides. So going over the organizer again, if it's anterior you always flex it to fold and hold. For cervical spine, SARA's our friend. Side bend away, rotate away. For thoracic spine, you side bend towards and rotate away. Lumbar you flip it, so you side bend away, rotate toward, and ribs are totally different. So you side bend toward, rotate toward. For the posterior points, you always extend except for ribs, which are weird, they flex. And the rest of them SARA is still our friend, so you side bend away and you rotate away. So now you have what we call the maverick points. They don't follow the fold and hold rules very well. So during an exam, it's more likely that you're going to get asked about a maverick point instead of one of these points. These are really easy to memorize, fold and hold. The mavericks take a little bit more memorization. So the first point is going to be anterior cervical 1. This point is located right behind the mandible, up high near the ear, AC1. Now it's AC1, there's only one motion, and it's going to be rotate away. One motion. So don't worry about flexion, don't worry about extension, don't worry about side bending. One motion, rotate away. The next point is going to be AC7. AC7 is located at the sternoclavicular joint, the SC joint. This is where your SCM attaches to your clavicle and sternum. When you think about what motion does the SCM do, it side bends towards and rotates away to shorten the muscle. So using fold and hold, if you want to shorten that muscle, you're going to do what it does. So you are going to flex, side bend toward and rotate away. Another way to remember this is that this motion is just like the thoracic spine, flex, side bend toward, rotate away. If it helps, just remember thoracic spine minus one vertebra, and now you're at AC7. So flex, side bend toward, rotate away. The next maverick point is going to be anterior thoracic points 1 through 6. Now when you're doing these points, there's only one motion that you need to do. It's located on the anterior side, flex forward. So all you do is flex. No side bending, no rotation, flex. Next you have the anterior lumbar points. You have the AL1 and AL5. Now where are these located? These are located on the ASIS in the AIIS. So if you're looking at a picture of where these would be, you can imagine this is the sacrum, this is your hip bone, the ASIS is located up top and the AIIS is located more inferior. So when I'm palpating these structures, AL1 is going to be located at the ASIS, point 2 is going to be located medial to the AIIS, point 3 is lateral and point 4 is inferior. Point 5 is located on the pubic tubercle. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ASIS, AIIS, pubic tubercle. So going back to how to treat AL1, the position is going to be just like AC7. So you're going to flex, you're going to side bend towards, and you're going to rotate away. So just how one of our organizers was AC7 is thoracic spine minus one, you can remember AL1 is thoracic spine plus one. So AL1, flex, side bend toward, rotate away. Then you have AL5, which was located on the pubic tubercle. This treatment position is going to be F, side bend away and rotate away. I'll let you make up your own pneumonic for that one. So then you have the maverick points for the posterior side. You have posterior cervical point 1, located in the midline. So just like AC1, this midline point of number 1 is going to have one motion, and it's going to be flexion. No side bending, no rotation, just flexion. Maverick point because since it's on the posterior side and you're thinking of fold and hold, you'd want to extend. But for this point you flex. Next point is going to be posterior cervical point 3, located in the midline. Now this one, SARA's going to be your friend again. So F, side bend away and rotate away. So this is maverick because it's on the posterior side and you want to extend, but in reality you flex. So it's maverick. F, side bend away, rotate away. So then you have posterior thoracic midline points. So all of the points in the midline for posterior thoracic are going to be treated this way. The way that you treat these is extension. You don't do anything else. No rotation, no side bending, just extension. Easy to remember that because it's on the posterior side and you want to shorten the muscles there, you're just going to extend. It's a maverick point because there's no side bending and no rotation. Last point is going to be your posterior rib point for number 1, for rib number 1. The way that you treat this is you are going to put the patient into extension, you're going to side bend away, and you're going to rotate towards. So some of these points you just have to memorize. I don't have a pneumonic for it. So posterior rib point 1, E, side bend away, rotate toward. You just got to memorize it. So we're going to close out this lecture by discussing the difference between tender points and trigger points. They both don't have anything to do with each other, other than they both start with the letter T so they can be confused by students very easily. So there's differences between trigger points and tender points. So a tender point is what we've been talking about this entire time. It's a singular point. Now when you poke it, the pain does not radiate. And the way that you treat a tender point is with counterstrain. A trigger point, which you should be calling a trigger band so that you don't confuse the two with one another, isn't a singular point but it's an entire band that's tight. And when you poke on this band, the pain will radiate. And when you find a trigger band, you're going to treat it with myofascial, which we will discuss in one of the next lectures. So completely different than the rest of the lecture and doesn't help with counterstrain, but still very important to know the difference between a tender point and a trigger band. So during this lecture, we talked all about counterstrain. We went over what a tender point is, how it starts, the exact treatment order, which you must follow every time, the difference between tender and trigger points, and try to give you an advanced organizer for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and rib counterstrain points so that you can get this stuff right. And that's counterstrain. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to OMM v2]  
﻿Learning OMM is a lot like learning a completely new language. You have to understand the basic vocabulary before you can understand everything else that's to come. The way that the OMM course is laid out is in a very specific order. So, you should watch this video lecture series in that specific order. It's so that these concepts and core ideas will start to build on top of one another, so it all makes sense. For you to do well in osteopathy, of course, you need to learn what I'm saying, but you also need to have a deep understanding of the core concepts. When you're taking an exam or you're in the clinic, you're going to see things that you haven't exactly studied before but if you understand the core concepts of osteopathy, you should be able to tackle just about anything that's thrown at you. So, to start off, we'll say what is a dysfunction. So, a dysfunction is simply an abnormal function of normal anatomy. So, let's say that you can typically flex your arm and extend your arm. If you can't flex your arm all the way, that's an abnormal function of the anatomy that's going to be a dysfunction. So, dysfunction is abnormal anatomy. So, how are we going to name these dysfunctions, so that each physician knows what the other physician is talking about? We're going to name them somatic dysfunctions. So, how are we going to name it? This is going to seem pretty weird, but you want to name it by what it can do. Now, you may be thinking that you want to say what the muscle can't do, but it's the opposite. You always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So, in our example for the patient that wasn't able to flex his arm, but he can extend his arm all the way out, this is going to be called an extension dysfunction. He can extend, he cannot flex, it's called an extension dysfunction. So, you always name it a somatic dysfunction by what it can do. Always by what it can do. So, when you're palpating or assessing a somatic dysfunction with your hands, you're going to have different palpatory findings based off if the dysfunction is acute or brand-new, or if it's chronic and it's been lingering around for a while. These different palpatory changes are called your TART findings and TART stands for Texture, Asymmetry, Restriction and Tenderness. So, if you're palpating and assessing an acute dysfunction, the tissue texture may be hot or boggy, or maybe even moist. So, imagine if you just stubbed your toe, it might feel pretty hot if you touch it. It might even feel pretty moist. Acute dysfunction. It just happened. It's hot and burning. Asymmetry, you're going to notice palpable asymmetry on both sides of the dysfunction. For restriction when you ask the patient to move, it's going to be painful on motion. So back to our patient who stubbed his toe, if we ask him to move his toe around, it may be really painful at first. That's going to tell you it's an acute dysfunction. Now, what about tenderness? For tenderness of an acute dysfunction it's going to be sharp pain. Now imagine if you just stubbed your toe, you don't want anyone cramming their fingers on it that's going to hurt, so it's sharp pain. So just remember if you have an acute dysfunction think of these red-hot findings. Now we are going to compare this to a chronic dysfunction. The tissue texture is going to be cool or ropy or maybe even dry. So, if they stub their toe last week and you're going to palpate that toe, it's probably going to feel a little bit cooler than it did when it was an acute injury. You're still going to have palpable asymmetry, but when you ask the patient to move around, they're going to have a decreased pain or maybe they won't have any pain when they move. So, asking the patient to move their stubbed toe that they stabbed last week, it may not be hurtful. So, for tenderness, it's going to feel like dull achy pain. If they stub their toe last week and you're pushing on it, it may just feel dull, because it's starting to heal. So, when you think of chronic dysfunctions, think of cool blue findings and compare that to acute dysfunctions, which would be red-hot findings. So, the next thing that you need to understand our planes and axes of motion and to do that, we're going to draw out some pictures. So, a plane is simply a flat surface and this flat surface is going to be a surface where motion occurs or where you divide the body. There are three different planes that you need to know. The first plane is going to be the sagittal plane. The sagittal plane is going to divide the body right down the bridge of the nose and it's going to split both sides of the body into two equal parts. The next plane is the transverse plane. The transverse plane is going to split the body horizontally. So, if that transverse plane is going from hip to hip, you're going to have a superior side and an inferior side, two different sections. The third plane of motion is going to be your coronal plane. Now imagine that you're wearing a crown, a crown for coronal. It's going to divide your body between an anterior and posterior point going down the ears. So, split your body into an anterior and posterior side. Now this is going to be compared to an access. An access is just a singular point that the body will move around and there are three different axes that you need to be aware of. The first axis is a horizontal axis. It goes horizontally through the body. It's a singular point. So, imagine the pen is the horizontal axis going from hip to hip. It's that singular point. The next axis is a vertical axis that goes vertically through the body. So, the vertical axis will be going from my head to feet and the third axis is an AP axis, or anterior posterior, goes from the anterior to posterior side. Now these axes can be located anywhere on the body. For example, an AP axis could be at the chest, on the foot, in the hand, on the head wherever, you just need to understand that motion will occur around the axis. So, there are three primary motions of the body and we're going to relate those to the planes and axes of motion. The three type of body movements are going to be flexion and extension, rotation and side bending and we are going to talk about how these motions occur on a specific plane and around a specific axis. So, what is flexion and extension. Flexion is just bending forward. It's approximating two ends of whatever joint that you're doing. So, in this example, the joint would be from your chest to your knees. You're bending forward to bring the two ends closer together, that's flexion. Extension is going the opposite direction, bringing both ends further away from one another. So flexion is forward, extension is backward. Now how does this relate to planes and axes of motion? The motion will occur o a plane and around an axis. So, for example think of an umbrella. An umbrella has a handle and a canopy that protects you from the rain. When you twist the handle, it's going to twist the canopy on the top. Now imagine that the handle is your access and the umbrella canopy is your plane of motion. That plane of motion is going around the axis that you're spinning. So, for flexion and extension, it's going to be on a sagittal plane and around a horizontal axis. So using our umbrella example, imagine the umbrella handle is going from hip to hip. When you twist the handle forward that's going to cause flexion and when you twist the handle backward around the axis that's going to cause extension. So, flexion extension on a sagittal plane, but around a horizontal axis. Now rotation is going to be on the transverse plane and on a vertical axis. So back to our umbrella example, imagine that you have a vertical axis. You're twisting the handle and now the body is rotating around that axis. And finally, for side bending that's going to occur on a coronal plane and around an AP axis. So, with the umbrella example again the AP axis going through, you're going to twist the umbrella handle and that's going to cause motion in those directions. So, side bending occurs on a coronal plane around an AP axis. If it helps you remember, think of the colors. Green flexion extension, sagittal horizontal blue and red. The next concept that you need to understand are the barriers of motion. To demonstrate the barrier, I'm going to draw one vertebra looking from the top down and there are different barriers that you need to understand. The first is neutral. Now neutral is where the body anatomy is going to lie when the patient is relaxed or there in neutral. So, if I'm just standing comfortably wherever my spine is is going to be considered neutral. So neutral is in a relaxed position. The next barrier is going to be the physiologic barrier. So, what's this? Imagine that you're rotating your neck, you're using your neck muscles to induce that rotation. However far you can contract your muscles to rotate your head is the physiologic barrier. So, if I'm actively contracting my muscles and I can look over my shoulder and not go any further, that's the physiologic barrier. So active motion or using your own muscles. The next barrier is going to be the anatomic barrier. Now the anatomic barrier is a little bit further than the physiologic barrier. Imagine a physician comes and he tries to rotate your neck. He can probably go just a little bit further than you're able to go by contracting your muscles. That newly found barrier is going to be the anatomic barrier. That's the maximum length that the anatomy can go without causing structural damage. That'll be the anatomic barrier, which you can reach through passive motion. One final barrier that you need to be aware of is the restrictive barrier. Now the restrictive barrier is an abnormal barrier. It's abnormally functioning anatomy. So back to our head turning example, if you can turn your head all the way to the right normally, but when you try and rotate the other direction, it doesn't want to go very far and it stops before the physiologic barrier, that's going to be the restrictive barrier. Now the restrictive barrier is what you're going to name somatic dysfunctions on. So restrictive is the abnormal barrier. So back to our head rotation example, you can rotate to the left, but you cannot rotate to the right. You always name it by what it can do, so don't get tripped up. So, you can rotate to left, so this is a left rotation dysfunction. Remember always name by what you can do. In the example that we drew with the vertebra, you can rotate the segment to the right all the way to the anatomic barrier, but when you begin to rotate to the left, you're going to reach the restricted barrier very quickly. You can't rotate left, but you can rotate right. So, it's a right rotation this function. The final piece of vocabulary that you need to know are muscle contraction types. The first muscle contraction type is isotonic and there are two versions. The first is concentric. So, what is a concentric contraction? A concentric contraction is when you activate your muscle and it's going to bring the origin and insertion or the two ends of the muscle closer together. So, to imagine this in realistic terms when you're in the gym, you're lifting weights for your bicep curls, you're activating your biceps and you're bringing the two ends of the muscle closer together during your positive motion. This is going to be a concentric contraction. So, it's a contraction that leads to approximation of the ends of the muscle. Now the other type of isotonic contraction is Eccentric. This is where when you're contracting the muscle, an elongation is going to occur bringing the two ends of the muscle further apart from one another. Back to our gym example you're doing your positives, which is a concentric contraction. When you start to release a little bit of pressure, but you're still contracting and going down into your negative motion, that's going to be eccentric contraction. You're still contracting your biceps, but you're going out further. So, the two ends of the muscle get further apart. The next type of muscle contraction is going to be isolytic. Now this muscle contraction is where an outside force comes and breaks the patient's muscle contraction force thus causing a rapid elongation of the muscle and separating the two ends of the muscle. For an example, imagine that someone's arm wrestling. Both people are contracting their arms together, but eventually one of them is going to win and break the contraction of the other person. That breaking is isolytic contraction. So, breaking the force. The final type of contraction is going to be isometric. Now in osteopathy isometric is probably going to be the most important type of muscle contraction. This is a type of muscle contraction that you are going to perform on your patients when you're treating them with muscle energy. We'll discuss that in one of the next videos. Isometric contraction is when the patient is making a contraction, but there is an outside force probably from the physician that's equal and because of that both forces cancel out and there's no approximation or lengthening of the muscle, even though the muscle is still contracted. So, two different forces coming together that equal each other out. Both muscles are contracted, but the ends are not approximating or elongating. So, there's no change in the ends of the muscle during an isometric contraction. So, we went over a lot of stuff, but it's really important that you understand the vocabulary before you move on trying to understand the rest of OMM. We discussed what a dysfunction is and how you name it by what it can do. We discussed the TART changes for red-hot acute dysfunctions and cool blue dysfunctions for chronic. We talked about planes and axes of motion. We went over the different barriers that you can reach and we wrapped it up with different types of muscle contractions and that's your introduction to OMM. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to OMM]  
﻿Learning OMM is a lot like learning a completely different language. You have to learn the vocabulary first so you can understand everything that's to come later on. The way that this course is laid out is in a very particular order. So if you watch it in that order, all the topics, concepts and language that we use is introduced throughout, so that at the end it all makes sense. For you to do well in this course, not only do you need to understand the information that I give you, but you also need to be able to learn the concepts and be able to apply the concepts to different situations. When you take an exam, you're going to see information that you haven't seen before, and what the exam writer is wanting to do is to see if you know the concepts. So in this lecture we're going to go over some of the basic vocabulary that you're going to use for the rest of the course. So to start off with, what is a dysfunction? A dysfunction is basically an abnormal function of normal anatomy. So what you can and cannot do. So an example of this would be normally I can flex my arm all the way in, I can extend my arm all the way out. If I cannot bring my arm all the way into flexion, that's what we would call a somatic dysfunction. So abnormal function of anatomy. So how do we name a dysfunction? How do we know between each practitioner what we're talking about? What you need to do is you need to name the dysfunction for what the segment can do. It sounds confusing because you want to say that the arm cannot flex, so you think that you want to say can't flex. In reality, what you say is the patient has a extension dysfunction, which means that they can extend and they cannot flex. So you always name it by what it can do. So how do I find some of these dysfunctions? What are some of the palpatory findings I'm going to see? This is what classifies as a TART change, and TART stands for texture, asymmetry, restriction and tenderness. And depending on if the dysfunction is acute or chronic, you're going to have different findings for each section. If you have an acute dysfunction and you're palpating the tissues, you're going to feel hot tissues or boggy or even moist. So think about it as being brand new. It's still red hot. So the dysfunctional palpatory findings will be hot, boggy, moist when you palpate the skin. When you do your palpation, you're also going to feel asymmetry, so one side is not going to feel the same way that the other side will feel. It'll feel asymmetric. For restriction, we're really talking about pain on motion. So since it's brand new, it's an acute dysfunction, you can imagine that there's going to be a lot of pain on movement. So let's say if the patient just hurt their back and they just got a spine somatic dysfunction, when they bend forward or try and rotate, it may be very painful. And this is telling you that it's an acute dysfunction. For tenderness, they're doing the quality of the pain. So if it's acute, the pain will be intense or sharp. So if I take my thumb and I jam it, whatever muscle is dysfunctional is going to feel intense, it's going to feel sharp. So if on an exam you have any of these findings, the exam writer is trying to tell you that it's an acute dysfunction. And then we're going to compare that to chronic. Chronic or ongoing dysfunction is going to have palpatory findings that are basically the opposite of acute. So you're going to feel cool tissues or they're going to be ropey tissues or they'll be dry tissues. When you're feeling for symmetry, you're still going to palpate asymmetry, so that's going to be the same for acute and for chronic. If it's a chronic dysfunction, it's been lingering a little while. The rest of your body is starting to compensate, so it may have decreased pain on motion or even no pain on motion at all. And if it's been sitting around a while, it's not going to be nearly as intense or nearly as sharp as it was when it first occurred. So it's going to be more of an achy pain or a dull pain. So when you jam your thumb into it, it feels more achy or it feels more dull. So there are three primary motions that occur in every segment. You can have flexion, which is bending forward or anteriorly, you can have extension, which is bending back posteriorly. You can have rotation, which is turning your body, and you can have side bending, which is moving your body to the left and to the right like this. Each of these motions occur in a plane, in a round and axis. So to label the planes of motion, we're going to use some pictures. So a plane of motion, you can almost imagine it as if the body is being cut directly in the motion, and you're getting two equal slices on each side. So for a sagittal plane, it's a plane that cuts right along the bridge of the nose and goes directly down the rest of the body. So you're going to be split right down the middle like this. For a transverse plane, it's going to go from ear to ear. It's going to go horizontally. So transverse plane would be if I get a cut right here and I can separate the top half and the lower half of my body into two completely different segments. So the last plane is the coronal plane. Now this plane, imagine if you're wearing a crown for your coronal plane, and it cuts directly down the middle. So it'll be a slice just right here and it will fold out your body like this. So next there are three axes of motion. You can have a horizontal axis, which is a singular line that goes through the body. So imagine if I take the pen, push it through my body, that's the axis. You're not cutting the entire body, it's a singular point. So horizontal axis goes from hip to hip. A vertical axis goes from the top of the body all the way down to the bottom. So if I take the same pen, through the head, out the feet, that's the vertical axis. And finally, you have an AP axis, or an anterior posterior axis. It goes directly from the anterior side to the posterior side. So if I push directly towards me. Now each of these axes can be moved slightly around the body, depending on where you want to be turning. So the AP axis can be located in the center, it can be located around the neck, on the hand, wherever. But wherever the axis is, the rest of the rotational component will occur around that axis. So now to talk about flexion, extension and side bending. So each of these motions will occur on a plane and around an axis. So the easiest way to think about this would be think about an umbrella. An umbrella has a handle and it also has a gigantic upper part that protects you from the rain. If you're twisting the handle around, the top part will spin around as well. If you imagine the handle of the umbrella is the axis and the umbrella itself is the plane, then that gives you an idea of how the planes of motion actually work around each axis. So if we're talking about flexion and extension, we need to relate that to the umbrella. The easiest way would be to stick one of your arms up and then flex and extend. And when I'm making that motion, I'm drawing the plan with my arm going around. And that plane is going to be a sagittal plane. Now with that same analogy, imagine that I'm taking an axis and going 90 degrees at the plane, which means that it will go directly through my hips. So if I take that umbrella handle and twist it, I'm flexing forward and I am extending backwards. So the plane that flexion extension occurs on is the sagittal plan, and the axis that it goes around is horizontal. Now for rotation, it's the same umbrella idea. If I stick my arms out and I rotate, I'm drawing the transverse plane with my arms. If I'm wanting to do the rotation on the umbrella stick, I'm twisting my body around it, so it's going to be the vertical axis. And for side bending, the same idea. If I stick my arm out and I side bend, I can draw the plane with my arm. That plane that I'm drawing is the coronal plane, and the 90 degree axis is going to be the AP axis. So now that you understand the axes and planes of each motion, you need to understand the barriers and you need to learn the vocabulary for barriers. So to do this, we are going to look at a single vertebral unit. So there are a few different barriers that you need to learn the names of. The first one is neutral. So in neutral, the patient is totally relaxed. They're sitting still. This is how the anatomy normally sits in neutral. So relaxed. The next barrier is going to be the physiologic barrier. Now if I'm going to take my vertebral segment and rotate around this axis and I get to the P, that's the physiologic barrier. Now physiologic is the range of motion that the patient has during active movement. So if I am actively trying to rotate my head to the right and that's as far as I can go, that's the physiologic barrier. So active motion. The next barrier that you're going to hit is the anatomic barrier. Now, if the practitioner comes in and they decide that they're going to rotate my head, they can probably move my head more in the rotation than I would be on my own. So that passive motion is going to reach a further barrier. That's the anatomic barrier. Now the final barrier that you need to understand is the restrictive barrier. So the restrictive barrier is some sort of abnormal barrier, a barrier where you shouldn't be stuck at. So if I'm rotating this vertebral segment all the way down to the left, so if I'm rotating to the left, I should be able to passively move the segment all the way to the anatomic barrier. But if I get stuck here and I can only rotate a little bit, that's the restrictive barrier. Now once again, they're not able to rotate all the way to the restrictive barrier. This is confusing because of how you want to name the diagnosis. Remember, you always want to name it based off what it can do. So it seems backwards, because you want to say it's stuck rotated in this direction. In reality, you want to say what it can do. So it can rotate the other direction normally, and that's what you would name it on. So the last thing that you need to understand is the types of muscle contractions. And there are two types of isotonic muscle contractions. You have concentric and eccentric. Now concentric muscle contraction is when the patient actively contracts their muscle, it brings the origin and the insertion closer together. So if I am concentrically contracting my bicep, I'm bringing my arm further this direction. So one way to think about it would be you're at the gym, you're doing your positives for your gains, you're bringing your arm up, that's a concentric motion. An eccentric contraction is a lengthening of the muscle while the patient is still contracting the muscle. Easy way to think about eccentric contraction is if you're still in the gym, you're doing your negatives, so you've already flexed up. You have the weight, you're still contracting the muscle, but you're slowly elongating the muscle. This elongation is eccentric. Next type of muscle contraction is isolytic. Isolytic is where an outside force breaks the patient's muscle contraction 100 percent. So the easiest way to think about this would be if you are arm wrestling someone who is bigger than you. When you're arm wrestling, you're holding it steady, but eventually their strength overtakes you and you let it go. That is isolytic. It's breaking your muscle contraction. And the final muscle contraction type is isometric. Isometric is the most important muscle contraction for osteopathy. This is the type of muscle contraction that we're going for during most of our treatments. So isometric means that the amount of contraction that the patient is exhibiting is the same amount of contraction that the practitioner is exhibiting, so both forces cancel each other out. So even though I'm pushing, I'm not elongating and I'm not shortening the muscle group. So that's isometric. So this is the vocabulary that you're going to need to continue with the rest of the course. We started off with what is a dysfunction? How do you name the dysfunction? TART changes for acute and chronic dysfunctions. Planes of motion, axes of motion with our umbrella. Then specific barriers, including neutral, physiologic, anatomic and restrictive, and different types of muscle contractions. And that's the introduction for OMM. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Lumbar Spine and Psoas]  
﻿This lecture is about the lumbar area. It's more of a miscellaneous lecture just to pick up bits and pieces that didn't really fit into other discussions. So we're going to break this lecture into three big groups. We're going to talk about diagnosis of the lumbar vertebra, we're going to talk about large muscle groups and how to treat with myofascial, and then we're going to close out with the very important muscle, psoas. So we're going to start out with how to diagnose the lumbar spine. So the way that you're going to do this is the exact same way that you diagnose the thoracic spine. So you're going to assess for rotation in neutral, you're going to assess for rotation in flexion, extension, use Fryette's laws, it's exactly the same as thoracic spine. So that's the first block of this lecture. Lumbar spine is the exact same as thoracic spine. So now we're going to move over to muscle groups and how to treat with myofascial. You can use myofascial technique to treat many different muscles, but the easiest way to go over an example is going to be the large muscles of the spine. So to do that, we're going to first draw a picture. This will give you an idea of what we're talking about. So the large muscles groups that we're going to go over are the erector spinae, and this includes spinalis, which runs closest to the spine. This includes the longissimus, which is the next muscle lateral, and this includes the iliocostalis, which is the most lateral. Then you have multifidus, which runs close to the spine but is the deepest of the muscles that we're going to discuss, and then you have quadratus lumborum. So the reason that we're going to name these muscles is so that we can go over how to use myofascial technique to treat it. So let's say that we have a dysfunction in one of these muscles. When one of these muscles is dysfunctional, it's going to become hypertonic. So if you think about what these muscles originally do, they're located on the posterior side of the body near the spine. They're going to assist in extension of just standing up straight. So we're going to use these muscles to talk about how to use the myofascial technique. And this is a good time to remind you that OMM is a lot about learning the concepts of treatment. So myofascial is not necessarily the best way to treat these muscle groups, it's just one way that you can treat them. If you want to think up a way to use muscle energy, that's acceptable. If you want to use counterstrain, if you want to, then that's acceptable. But this is an easy group to talk about how to use myofascial. So the idea behind myofascial is that you're going to balance the tissue in three planes of motion. You're going to use traction, rotation and compression. So you're going to palpate the back of where the muscle groups are and you're going to add linear traction, either along the muscle or parallel to the muscle. You're going to include rotation of the muscle, which is just like a clock face, clockwise or counterclockwise, and then you can add compression to the muscle to really engage the tissue. If it's a superficial muscle, you don't have to use as much compression. If you're talking about a deep muscle like multifidus, you may need to add more compression to engage the tissues. So which direction do I move the tissues? So as we discussed in one of the previous sections, myofascial technique can be direct or indirect. Remember that direct means engaging the barrier and indirect means engaging the freedom, or doing what the muscle can do. So for our example, these muscle groups induce spinal extension. So if these muscle groups are hypertonic and the origin and insertion come closer together, that's going to be into extension. So the freedom of motion for these dysfunctional muscles will be extension. The barrier will be what they cannot do, which is elongating the muscle into flexion. So if we're going to engage the direct barrier, for this example that means that we're going to push into flexion or we are going to elongate the muscles. The way that we're going to do this is add traction, rotation and compression to the muscle in order to elongate it, or until we feel a hard end feel during treatment. Now we're going to do the opposite of that for indirect. We're going to engage the freedom, meaning that during our traction, rotation and compression, we are going to move the muscle into the position of ease or the position where it wants to go to the freedom. So as we're doing this, we're going to know we're in the right spot when the tissues feel loose under our hands after we've applied the three planes of motion. Also, as we discussed in one of the previous lectures, myofascial technique can either be active or passive. And the way that this is going to come into play is by using enhancers. Enhancers is another way that you can change the technique in order to best fit your patient. So if we're going to use enhancers for this treatment, I'm going to set the patient up into the three planes and either engage the direct or indirect barrier, and then I'm going to ask the patient to flex the muscle groups. So I'm going to ask him to extend his spine to engage these muscles. That's going to be your enhancer, and that makes it an active technique. If you are going to use enhancers for different muscle groups, you're just going to have them engage whatever muscle you're treating. So if you're doing myofascial to the diaphragm, you're going to ask the patient to inhale and exhale to engage the diaphragm. So once you have the patient in the correct barrier and you are using enhancers or not, you hold until you feel a release. Now the release can be one of many things. It can either be a warmth feeling, it can be a rush of fluid, it can be the tissues melting under your hands or becoming loose. You just hold it until you feel that feeling. Once you're there, you can release the three planes of motion, return to neutral, and always rescreen. For any treatment that you do, regardless of if it's myofascial, muscle energy, counterstrain, whatever, when you're done with the treatment you have to rescreen to assess for efficacy. So now we're going to leave myofascial behind, and this is part three of the lecture. This muscle is a board's favorite. It always shows up. It's the psoas muscle. An important concept to understand is where the muscle originates and where it inserts. This can give you a lot of information on what the muscle does and how you can best treat it. So the origin of the muscle is T12 to L5. And the insertion is the lesser trochanter of the femur. So if I'm going to draw a picture of where this muscle is, where this is the sacrum and this is the spine, it's going to attach to the lesser trochanter right here. So what's the action of this muscle? Well, if you think about it conceptually, when a muscle contracts it just brings the origin and insertion of the muscle closer together. So if you know that the origin is on the spine and the insertion is on the lesser trochanter of the femur and you contract the muscle, you're going to induce hip flexion, and it can also induce very slight external rotation of the leg. So what do you have if the muscle is dysfunctional? How do you tell in a patient? What are some of the findings that you'll see? So if it's dysfunctional, the patient may present with lower back pain. If you imagine that the muscle is hypertonic and they're constantly contracted, they may have some lower back pain. Easy one. The next one that you will see is a pelvic shift. So to demonstrate this, I'll do another picture. So here's your sacrum, here's your spine, here's your femur. And the psoas muscle is now hyper-contracted. This hypercontraction leads to the pelvic shift. So if this is contracted on the right side, you can imagine that the patient's pelvis is going to be shifted to the left. So if I'm going to demonstrate this, if my right psoas is contracted, making me lean this direction, my pelvis is now shifted to the left. Another finding that you may see is gait dysfunction. So as you can imagine, if someone has a pretty severe pelvic shift and they're stuck in this position, when they're walking they're going to have to compensate for that shift. So they're going to have some sort of gait abnormalities. Another thing that you may find is an increased lumbar lordosis. As the psoas contracts, it's going to change around your lumbosacral angle. And this lumbosacral angle can also be called a Ferguson angle. This angle basically explains how tipped forward your sacrum is in relation to your pelvic anatomy. So the more that you dip into flexion, the more intense your lumbosacral angle will be, which will then include an increased lumbar lordosis. Another finding that you'll see a positive Thomas test. The Tomas test is when you have a patient laying on the table supine, and they have both of their legs dangling off of the edge of the table. You ask the patient to raise one of their legs up and bring their knee close to their chest. If the other side psoas muscle is dysfunctional or contracted, the other leg will passively come off the table as well. It's going to be pulled off the table by this hypertonic psoas muscle. And one final finding that you're going to have is spinal dysfunction. So as you can imagine, since the origin of the psoas is on part of the spine, if it contracts it's going to induce flexion, rotation and side bending ipsilaterally, so to the same side of dysfunction. So what can cause one of these dysfunctions? There are a few different ways that it can happen. One way is by bending forward. So let's say that you have a patient come in. He's having gait dysfunction and a positive Thomas test. He also explains that he's a carpenter and he is constantly bent over his work table for long periods of time. That excess bending forward can induce a psoas dysfunction. Another cause of dysfunction can be if you activate the muscle too quickly, as in getting out of a chair. Imagine you're calling your grandpa sitting at home. He's sitting in his chair, he hears the phone ring, and he jumps up because he's so excited. That quick jumping motion can cause a psoas dysfunction. So not only can you get a dysfunction through movement, but you can also get a dysfunction throughout other body organs. So one test favorite is ureteral calculi. If you think about anatomically where the ureters lie, they run over the psoas muscle. So if there is a calculus found inside of the ureter and it starts to become inflamed and bother the tissues around it, it can cause a psoas dysfunction. Same concept behind diverticulosis. So we have the patient, have how to identify it and we have what causes it. So how do we treat it? So once again, you have to bring up concepts from the past. So you can treat this using multiple different strategies that we have learned in the past. You can use muscle energy. You just have to remember how muscle energy works. So you stretch the muscle, engage the barrier, ask the patient to isometrically contract. If you want to, you can try and use myofascial. It may be difficult to use myofascial because you're not going to be able to compress the psoas muscle as well without squishing their organs. Or you can do everyone's favorite, counterstrain. Remember, counterstrain is an indirect technique. That's why we're going to write it in blue. So if you want to find the tender point, you have to know where the ASIS is and where the umbilicus is. Once that you know where these two landmarks are, you then have to travel two-thirds of the distance between them and palpate deep. That's where the tender point will be for the psoas muscle. Now if you want to treat it using counterstrain, what do you have to remember? Fold and hold. So the easiest way to think about fold and hold is put the muscle where it can go. Do what the muscle does when it contracts. So what does the muscle do when it contracts? Goes into flexion and it externally rotates. So if you're going to treat using counterstrain, flex the spine, side bend the side towards the muscle, and if you need to adjust a tiny bit, you can induce a little bit of external rotation of the leg. So once again, applying this to what we know about what the muscle does, the muscle flexes the spine, side bends the spine toward the side of dysfunction, and slightly externally rotates the leg. So that's the exact position that we're going to put it in because this is an indirect technique. So this lecture was a grab bag. We went over three big topics. We went over how you diagnose the lumbar vertebral segments. It's exactly the same as the thoracic vertebral segments. We went over the large muscle groups of the back in order to give an example of how to use myofascial technique. And we also went over the really important muscle of the psoas, including origin, insertion, dysfunction, and everybody's favorite, counterstrain. And that's OMM of the lumbar area. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Lymphatics]  
﻿When learning about the lymphatics, it's often easy to get weighed down with all the detail of where the system goes, what body part drains into what. But we're going to keep this very osteopathically focused and show you exactly what you need to know in order to get the question correct. There's a simple flow that you have to follow for every single patient every single time. So if you have a lymphatic question, go through this flow every single time and you'll get the question correct every single time. So to start off with, how does the lymph normally move throughout the lymphatic system? There are two big forces that help push the lymph throughout the lymphatic system. You can have smooth muscle contraction and compression. So imagine that you have fluid stasis in your lower extremities. When you're walking around, you're compressing the vessels in your lower extremities, and that's forcing the fluid to go back up throughout the rest of the system. When you're thinking about smooth muscle, imagine something as being squeezed at one end and it's forcing everything else in the same direction. That's the idea of what normal motion is. So what are you going to see in a patient who has some sort of abnormal motion? Oftentimes you're going to see some sort of fluid stasis. If you see a patient who has some sort of fluid stasis, you may want to consider treating the lymphatic system. Another patient that you might want to treat is one who has a mild infection. We're going to loop back around to mild infection at the end of the lecture. So what about some contraindications for treating the lymphatics? The main contraindications that you need to think about are fractures, cancer, mainly metastatic cancer, and severe infection. The general idea is that if a patient has one of these three things, you don't want to make the condition any worse by spreading it around by doing some sort of lymphatic technique. So what's the formula that I need to know in order to get these questions correct? So let's imagine that the waves of water represent some sort of fluid stasis somewhere in the body. The idea is that it gets stuck because of a choke point. The choke point is simply some sort of clog or choke in the lymphatic system. The choke makes it so that the rest of the lymphatic fluid cannot flow through that area, thus creating the choke point. There are numerous choke points throughout the body, and there are really five major ones that we're going to talk about. So why do these choke point even matter? The whole formula is that you have to treat the choke points in a certain order. You always follow the order, no matter what. You always start in one place, you end up in the last place. Never skip around in the order. So what are these choke points? The first one that you always want to treat first is the thoracic outlet. So theoretically, there can be many different things that cause a thoracic outlet choke point. Anything in the area can really do it. But two common ones that you can see are clavicle dysfunctions in ribs 1 and 2. If you have some sort of dysfunction in one of these two structures, then you may have a thoracic outlet choke. So how do you treat it? We've already talked about how you can treat these in previous lectures. So clavicle, you can treat the AC or the SC joint. In ribs 1 and 2, you can treat using an inhalation or exhalation treatment. The next choke point is going to be the diaphragm or the axilla. So what structure will cause a choke point at the diaphragm? The diaphragm. So when you're treating the diaphragm, how are you going to do it? You can dome the diaphragm, you can treat the attachment points at ribs 6 through 12, attachments points are L1 through L3, and xiphoid. We already talked about how you can treat ribs 6 through 12 and how you can treat L1 through L3, but we haven't talked about doming the diaphragm or the xiphoid. Just apply some of the concepts that you learned earlier in the lecture series. If you do a direct myofascial technique to the diaphragm, you can insert your fingers under the rib cage and push it where it does not want to go into the restrictive barrier. And the opposite for an indirect technique, push it into the freedom. So this is how you would treat the diaphragm, but what about the axilla? Just like for the thoracic outlet, anything that's up in the axillary region can cause a choke point in the area. But one common cause is pec minor. So if you want to assess the axilla for a choke point, assess pec minor. And if you want to treat it, apply some techniques that you learned earlier. You can either use muscle energy, you can use myofascial, whatever you feel like doing. The next choke point is going to be the hip. And what are some common dysfunctions that cause a hip choke point? You can have the psoas, the quads, and the innominates. We talked about how to treat these three structures in earlier lectures. If you are assessing for some sort of a hip choke point, check these three structures, and if they're dysfunctional, treat it and you'll treat the choke point. The next one down the list is going to be the posterior knee. So what can cause a choke point here? Think about some structures that attach to the posterior knee, like the hamstrings and the gastroc. If you want to treat the posterior knee, you can do it any way that you want to. You can do a direct myofascial technique and release the structures into the barrier, or you can push them into the freedom for an indirect technique. Muscle energy, engage the barrier, so on and so forth. Now what about the final choke point? The final choke point is going to be whatever the distal dysfunction is. And how are you going to treat it? You treat whatever the dysfunction is. So no matter what the dysfunction is, if you're treating the lymphatic system, you always have to follow the flow. You always start at the thoracic outlet. Then you move to the diaphragm or axilla, then you move to the hip, then you move to the posterior knee, and then you do the distal dysfunction. The only time that this changes is when you are assessing the thoracic outlet and they do not have a dysfunction in that area, you can skip it. You can't treat something that's not there. But if you skip it, you have to go to the next choke point down the list. So you have to go to the diaphragm or the axilla. Then you have to go to the hip. So what about diaphragm or axilla? If it's an upper extremity lymphatic issue and you're trying to treat the upper extremity, there's no real reason that you need to be treating the hip and the posterior knee. So you can treat the thoracic outlet, then go to the axilla, and then perform pump technique. So once that you've released all of the choke points in the very specific order that you have to go through every single time, you can then finish the treatment using a pump. There are a few different pumps that you can use in different situations. You have the pedal pump, which is also known as the Dalrymple pump. You can use the thoracic pump, which is also known as the Miller pump, or you can use extremity milking. So why would I use a different pump depending on which portion of the body I'm in? If you follow the example and the distal dysfunction is somewhere in the lower extremity, you'll want to do a pedal pump. Lower extremity, use the feet. And remember, this is a treatment where the patient is lying on their back, they have their feet out, and the doctor will push the feet forward quickly to get the fluid moving. If the lymphatic treatment that you're wanting to do is in the thoracic region, then you do the thoracic pump. If it's in the upper extremity, you can do extremity milking, where you just squeeze the upper arm to push the fluid in the direction. So now we're going to loop back to mild infections. If you have a patient who comes in with some sort of a common cold and you need to help move around some of the fluid in the sinuses, you can just do a facial sinus pump or effleurage. One treatment for otitis media would be the Galbreath maneuver. And remember, this is the technique where the physician grabs the angle of the mandible and pulls forward to help open up the Eustachian tube and get fluid moving. So in this lecture, we went over the order that you have to treat the lymphatic system in. No matter what the dysfunction is, you have to start at the thoracic outlet. If there is no dysfunction at the thoracic outlet, you can then move on to the next choke point down the list, which will be the diaphragm. No dysfunction, move down the list to the hip. No matter where it is, go through the list in the exact order. And then finish off your technique with one of the pumps. And that's OMM for lymphatics. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Posterior Chapman Points]  
﻿Here we go again with the Chapman's points. In the previous video we went over how to draw the anterior locations, but now we need to complete the set and talk about the posterior locations. This is going to be different than the anterior side, where the Chapman's points were located in the inter-rib spaces, on the posterior side they're located on the transverse processes. So, to start off we're going to draw our spine and our transverse processes and we're going to draw are spine down the middle. So, we're going to label all the lines that we went through C1, C2, T1, T2, all the way to T12. Then you move down to the lumbar spine. L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5. So, the first posterior Chapman's point is going to be on the transverse process of C1 and this point is going to represent your ear. The next point is on the transverse process of C2 and we're going to call this the ENT grab bag. It's going to include the nose, the sinus, the tonsils, the larynx and the pharynx. Next you move down to T2 transverse process on the posterior side and this is going to be your posterior Chapman's point for the heart. You can move down and draw two more red dots, which will represent your upper lung and your lower lung. Next, draw more red dots on T5, T6 and T7. Now remember you're looking at the body from the posterior side. So, the side that the stomach is going to be on is going to be on the left. So, this first point will be for your stomach acid. The second point is stomach motility and your third point is your spleen. So just keep it straight anatomically when you're looking on the posterior side these structures are on the left. If you move over to the right, these first two points are for your liver. You have a second point on the transverse process of T6 for your gallbladder and below that you have your pancreas. Next you can draw three more dots going down T8, T9 and T10. These are going to represent your posterior Chapman's point for your small intestines. So, we'll put a big S in a big I small intestine. So what about the large intestine? Large intestine is pretty unique. It covers the full area instead of just a point. It's going to be on the lateral sides of L2, L3 and L4 in a triangular shape. So, we'll draw a big L and then a big I for a large intestine and this will be bilaterally. So, L2, L3 and L4 large triangular shape going lateral. Next you need to draw the posterior Chapman point for the adrenal gland. We're going to make a triangle, because it looks like the cap of the kidney, then you can do the rest of the renal system by putting a dot on L1, L2 and L3. These are going to represent your kidney, your bladder and your urethra on both sides. So, your kidney, your bladder and your urethra. Next you have the weird GU Chapman's points on the posterior side. So, for this you're going to palpate out to the PSIS and here you're going to palpate the prostate, the vagina and the broad ligament. To finish it out, you need to put a posterior Chapman's point on the transverse processes of L5 for the uterus. Now location for the ovary is kind of tricky if you don't remember it. The way I remember it is the uterus is on L5, 5 x 2 is 10. So, the posterior Chapman's point for the ovary will be on T10. And finally, the last Chapman's Point. Don't forget it. It's for the appendix. It's going to be on the lateral side of T11. So here it is hanging off of T11. Don't forget the appendix. So, go home practice drawing this out a couple times, so that when it comes test day you can draw this out pretty quickly and get all the answers correct on where the posterior Chapman's points are located and that's OMM posterior Chapman's points. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Ribs]  
﻿When I was in school, one of my teachers told us that ribs are half the COMLEX. And while I may not agree with it being half of the questions on the COMLEX, there are definitely a large number of questions devoted specifically to ribs. So if you know how to get the correct diagnosis, then you can get the questions correct and it's some easy points. So to go over it, we're going to do some basic anatomy, some of the movements of the different ribs, the dysfunctions and how to treat them. So to start off with, we're going to go over the basic anatomy of the ribs. There are five landmarks on each rib that you're going to need to know. This is going to be the head, the neck, the tubercle, the angle and the shaft. And these landmarks are going to tell you if the rib is a typical rib or an atypical rib. So a typical rib has all five landmarks. It has a head, neck, tubercle, angle and a shaft. Ribs 3 through 10 are your typical ribs. So if you have typical ribs, you're going to have atypical ribs. An atypical rib either is missing a landmark or has an extra landmark. Rib 1 is atypical because it does not have an angle. Rib 2 is atypical because it has two tubercles. So rib 2, two tubercles. Ribs 11 and 12 are atypical because they do not have a tubercle or a neck. So you need to be able to classify ribs between typical and atypical. So there are three other classifications of ribs that you need to know. You need to know the difference between a true rib, a false rib and a floating rib. So a true rib as a rib that directly connects to the sternum. So we all know that all twelve ribs begin in the spine and the run all the way anteriorly to the sternum. The true ribs attach directly to the sternum. If we're going to draw this out, it'll look like this, where they attach to the sternum. The true ribs are ribs 1 through 7. Then you have the false ribs. They indirectly attach to the sternum. Their costal cartilage attaches to rib 7, which then attaches to the sternum. And this is ribs 8 through 10. And then you have what's called a floating rib. Floating rib does not connect to the sternum at all. So they're sitting all the way back at the spine without touching the sternum. The next thing that you need to learn is the motion of the ribs. Depending on which rib we're talking about, you're going to have a different type of motion. And there's three types of motion. You have pump handle, bucket handle and caliper. So we'll start off with pump handle. This is going to be ribs 1 through 5. So imagine an old-timey water pump, right? You have to pump the handle to get the water out. So relating that to the ribs, imagine that my elbow is the rib head back and the spine and my hand is the anterior portion of the rib. When I breathe in, the anterior portion will move upward, and when I breathe out, the anterior portion will move downward. So it's making this pump-like motion. So if I'm going to draw this as a picture, it will look something like this, where this is the rib, this is the sternum. During inhalation it moves up, and during exhalation it moves down. The next motion that we have is bucket handle, and this is ribs 6 through 10. So imagine that you have a water bucket. On the top it has that wire piece that goes back and forth. So relating that to the ribs, imagine that you're looking at ribs 6 through 10 and my arms are the ribs. When I breathe in, my ribs are going to go up into inhalation like this. And when I breathe out, they're going to swing back down into exhalation. So they move like a bucket handle, just like that. So if I'm going to draw this out, it'll look something like this, where this is the sternum, this is the rib, it moves up and it goes down. The final motion is caliper, and this'll be for ribs 11 through 12. So these ribs move a little bit differently. They don't attach to the sternum, so their motion is a little weird. So imagine that the ribs are attached to the back of the spine. When you breathe in, the ribs move outward, and when you breathe out, the ribs come back inward. This motion is called a caliper motion. So drawing this out, this is going to be the spine. Here's your caliper ribs, and now they move outward. So that's your caliper motion. So next we're going to talk about the muscles that you use during respiration. You can have primary muscles and secondary muscles. Your primary muscles of respiration are what you use when you're breathing when you're relaxed, and your secondary muscles are the muscles that you use when you need to get a little bit extra air in and out. So your primary muscles include your diaphragm and your intercostals. Important thing to note here is where the diaphragm attaches to the body. So the diaphragm attaches to ribs 6 through 12, L1 through L3, and the xiphoid. This is an important point for you to keep in mind. So if you're treating the diaphragm, you can do a direct technique where you're actively pushing underneath the ribcage to palpate the diaphragm, or you can treat one of these areas and technically you'll still be treating the diaphragm. You have your secondary muscles of respiration. You have your scalenes, you have pec minor, you have serratus anterior and you have your lats. So remember, you use your secondary muscles if you need to get a little bit more air in and a little bit more air out. Imagine when you're playing football, you got to breathe heavier. You're going to use your secondary muscles as well as your primary muscles. So what about rib dysfunction? So just like everywhere else in the body, everywhere throughout this course, you always name the dysfunction based off of what it can do. You're going to have two different types of dysfunctions. You can either have an inhaled dysfunction or an exhaled dysfunction. Inhaled meaning that the ribs can go into inhalation and exhaled means that the ribs can go into exhalation. So we'll start with inhaled. The ribs can go upwards into inhalation, and they cannot go downwards into exhalation. If you're going to treat this type of dysfunction, you use direct pressure. So when the patient is breathing in and the ribs are up, you would need to be the person that pushes the rib back down where it should go into exhalation. So the next type of dysfunction is exhaled. And it's going to be the opposite of inhaled. They cannot go up into inhalation, but they can go down into exhalation. So with an exhaled dysfunction, the ribs like to go down and they cannot get back up. The way that you treat these are going to be a little bit different than an inhaled dysfunction. For these, you're going to use muscle energy in order to pull the ribs back up into normal motion. And what muscles are you going to use? You're going to use the secondary muscles. So for rib number 1, you're going to use the anterior and middle scalene. For rib 2, you're going to use the posterior scalene. And then this is where the color coding helps us out. So ribs 3, 4 and 5 we're going to use pec minor. For 6, 7 and 8 we're going to use serratus anterior. And then for ribs 9 and 10, we're going to use the lats. Those are the muscles that you're going to use during your treatment. So how do you find the dysfunction in the first place? What you're going to do is you're going to ask the patient to lay on their back and you're going to palpate the ribs bilaterally as the patient breathes. When they go into inhalation, all the ribs should move upward into inhalation. When the patient exhales, all the ribs should go down into exhalation. As you're palpating both sides, you need to make a mental note of which way the ribs go. When the patient inhales and all the ribs move up, that's great. When the patient exhales, you notice that on the right side the ribs stay stuck into inhalation and they don't want to go into exhalation. So there's some sort of dysfunction over there. You always name it by what it can do, and since they can go into inhalation, that means it's an inhalation dysfunction. So the final part of this is talking about group dysfunctions. So one way to think about this is to compare it to an accordion. Everybody has an accordion at home that they play, right? So when you're playing the accordion, you go in and out. If one segment of that accordion doesn't work properly, it's going to jam up some of the other folds in the machine. So imagine the same thing for ribs. All of the ribs go upward and downward together, but if one of those ribs don't work properly, the group of ribs beside it is also going to become dysfunctional. That one rib that's causing the dysfunction for the group is called the key rib. How do you identify which rib is the key rib? We're going to use the BITE pneumonic. And the BITE pneumonic stands for bottom inhaled and top exhaled. So let's say you have a group inhalation dysfunction of ribs 5 through 7. Which rib is the key rib? Well, using the BITE pneumonic, you know it's the bottom rib, so it's rib number 7. If we're going to draw this out, it'll look something like this. So imagine that these are your palpatory findings. This group is the inhaled dysfunction and the bottom key rib is causing the rest of the ribs to stay stuck in inhalation. So this is your key rib. So this means that if you treat the key rib, the rest of the ribs will fall back into place as they should go. So remember, when the patient goes into inhalation, all of the ribs move up normally. This patient is now in exhalation. The bottom ribs went down normal, but because this key rib is stuck in inhalation, the top ribs cannot go downward normally. So you have to treat the key rib. Now let's do an exhalation dysfunction. Let's say that these are our palpatory findings for a patient during inhalation. The top ribs move normally into inhalation, they all move up. But because this key rib is dysfunctional, it's keeping the rest of the ribs below it in exhalation. So this means that you need to treat the key rib in order to get the rest of the ribs to move normally below it. And how are you going to treat this key rib? Well, it's an exhalation dysfunction, you go back to our exhalation treatments, figure out which rib it is, and then you're going to use that for muscle energy. So in this lecture we went over everything that you need to know about ribs. We talked about the anatomy and how you can divide the ribs into different groups, the typical motions, including pump, bucket and caliper, the primary and secondary muscles of respiration, how you name a dysfunction, and group dysfunctions. And that's OMM for ribs. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Rotator Cuff]  
﻿We're going to continue our discussion on the upper extremity by moving next to the sits muscles, or the muscles of the rotator cuff. We're not going to talk about the special tests, which you learned in anatomy and your MSK course, but instead we're going to talk about the function of the muscles and how we can relate this back to the treatment style and keep everything osteopathic focused. So what we're going to start off with is a picture of where the muscles are. So this is going to represent our scapula, and this is going to represent the humerus. I draw these to point out two important locations where the next three muscles are going to originate and insert. So the next three muscles all originate on the medial border of the scapula. All three of the next muscles will attach to the greater tubercle of the humerus. So we're going to go ahead and fill in our picture with the muscles, and the first muscle that we're going to start with, the supraspinatus. So the name of this muscle gives away where it's located. Supra, above, spinatus, spine of the scapula. So if we're going to draw it in, we're going to put it right here. Those are supraspinatus. The primary function of this muscle is AB duction, abduction. So what this muscle does is it abducts your arm. It pulls your arm away from the rest of your body, abduction. It's going to be innervated by the suprascapular nerve, and the nerve roots are going to be C5 and C6. The next muscle that we're going to talk about is the infraspinatus. This muscle name also tells you a little bit where it's about. Infra below, spinatus, spine. So below the spinal scapula, so we're going to put it right here. So what does this muscle do? This muscle, when it contracts, forces the arm to go into external rotation. So it will make the arm externally rotate outward. If my arm is already into AB duction, external rotation is going to look like this. So external rotation. So lucky for us, the nerve is easy to remember. It's the same nerve and it's also the same nerve roots. Super easy. The next muscle is teres minor. And the name doesn't help us with our location, but it's right below infraspinatus. Still originates at the medial border of the scapula and still attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus. The function, however, is going to be easy to remember. It does the same thing as infraspinatus, external rotation. The innervation is going to be a little bit different. It's going to be the axillary nerve, but the nerve roots are still going to be the same, C5 and C6. So we have the first three muscles down of the sits muscles. Now we have to finish with the fourth and final muscle. So to talk about this muscle, we're going to do another picture, except this time it's going to be from the anterior portion of the scapula. Previous pictures is the posterior side, this picture is the anterior side. This muscle is going to attach to a different location. It's going to be the lesser tubercle of the humerus, and it's going to originate in the subscapular fossa. This muscle is going to originate in the subscapular fossa and attach to the lesser tubercle from the anterior side. The name of this muscle is going to be subscapularis. So what does this muscle do? Well, we already have AB duction. The next two muscles did external rotation. Subscapularis does internal rotation. So if my arm is already out, internal rotation. My arm is flexed, this is internal rotation. So internal rotation. The nerve is going to be a little bit different. It's just the major and minor nerves to subscap. And the nerve roots are going to be the same except we add in an extra, C7. So to go over the muscles one more time, we have supraspinatus, AB duction, infraspinatus, external rotation, teres minor, more external rotation, and subscapularis, which is internal rotation. So sits muscles, S-I-T-S. AB duction, external rotation, external rotation, internal rotation. So now we're going to talk about dysfunctions and treatments for this muscle group. And what are we going to treat this with? Everybody's favorite, counterstrain. Now at this point in the video series, you should have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to be saying next. Counterstrain is an indirect technique. Put the muscle where it wants to go. Bring the origin and attachment closer together. Bring the origin and attachment closer together is just doing what the muscle typically does. So what position do you think that I'm going to put these muscles into to treat it with counterstrain? We already wrote them up all on the board. So this will be pretty quick. So for supraspinatus, we are going to put the muscle into AB duction, abduction, and if we put them there and we're going through the treatment position and the patient still says that the pain is not below a three out of ten like we want, we can modify it slightly. And the way that we're going to modify it is by adding external rotation and flexion. Just remember that the primary motion is going to be AB duction. The next one is infraspinatus. What does this muscle typically do? External rotation. So what are we going to put it in for counterstrain? External rotation. Again, if you're doing this treatment technique, you're still not getting the pain scale low enough to where you want it, then you can adjust with slight AB duction and slight flexion. The next muscle is going to be teres minor. And since it does the exact same motion as infraspinatus, you know it's going to be the exact same treatment position, infraspinatus. So when you're palpating these findings, where is the tender point going to be located? It's going to be located right where the muscle belly is. So when you're doing your palpations, if you feel a tender point on the superior side of the spine of the scapula, it's going to be supraspinatus. Infraspinatus, in the middle of the muscle belly, same with teres minor. So I say that to talk to you about subscapularis. Where am I going to feel that tender point since it's on the anterior side of the scapula? So what happens is the patient has their arm in AB duction and you're going to stick your finger in their armpit. There's a tiny bit of subscapularis that hangs out right here. If they have a tender point, this is where you're going to palpate it. So the final muscle is subscapularis. Counterstrain position, just like all the other ones, do what it likes to do. And what does it do? Internal rotation. And if this treatment position isn't getting the results that you want, you can add a slight bit of extension. Just remember that the primary motion is internal rotation. So this lecture's not too bad. It's the sits muscles, the muscles of the rotator cuff. Super highly tested, because these muscles are injured very frequently. So you need to remember what muscles do what motion, and how you would treat it with counterstrain. And that's OMM for the sits muscles. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sacral Diagnostics]  
﻿The sacrum is a topic that a lot of student have difficult with understanding, whether it's because there's tons of different motions, the diagnosis is difficult to make, whatever reason it is. But what we're going to do in this lecture is try and make it as simple as possible so you can get the questions correct on the exam. The first part of the lecture, we're going to talk about the motions that the sacrum goes through around what axis, and in the second part we're going to make a giant flow chart that will give you the diagnosis of the sacrum based on your findings. So we're going to start off with motions of the sacrum. So we're going to draw out the sacrum from the posterior side. So we're on the posterior side of the patient, we're looking towards the sacrum. This is going to be the base and this is going to be the apex. I drew it like this to make the angles very clear of where the sacral sulcus is and where the inferior lateral angle is. These two landmarks are going to be important when we start making our diagnosis. The next thing that you need to understand is how the sacrum moves. So imagine that I'm on the posterior side and this is the anterior side. My hand is going to be the sacrum. If the base of the sacrum moves anteriorly, this is considered sacral flexion. If the base of the sacrum moves posteriorly, this is considered sacral extension. So flexion forward, extension backward. This motion occurs around an axis. Now remember, from a previous lecture we had talked about an axis just being a linear point that something rotates around. So for the sacrum, you have one axis, sacrum is attached to it, flexed and extended around the axis. From a posterior side, flexed, extended around the axis. There are a few different axes, five in total, and you need to know what motion occurs at what axis. So to start off with, I'm going to talk about the midline axis. This axis is where postural motion occurs. So writing it out down here, midline is where postural motion occurs. So what do I mean by postural motion? When the patient is standing and he tips forward into flexion with his spine, the sacrum has to compensate. When you flex forward with your spine, the sacrum compensates by moving into extension around the midline axis. So it's opposite. So if you go into extension with your spine, your sacrum is going to move into flexion on the midline axis. So right now, if you flex the spine, you are going to extend the sacrum. If you extend the spine, you're going to flex the sacrum. So the next two axes that we're going to talk about are the oblique axes. There are two of them. There's a right oblique and a left oblique. The right oblique is named right because it goes through the right sacral sulcus. So right oblique. And the left oblique axis goes through the left sacral sulcus, left oblique. So writing that out, weight on left leg means that you're engaging the left oblique. And weight on right equals right oblique. The next axis that we're going to talk about is the superior axis. And there are two motions that occur around the superior axis. You have respiration and cranial. So how does this work during respiration? When you take a breath in and you inhale, the sacrum is going to go into slight extension. It's going to tip posteriorly into extension around the superior axis. So it's going to move like this, posteriorly. When you exhale, the sacrum is going to move in a flexion. The base will move anteriorly around the same axis. So writing that out, superior axis is for respiration and cranial. Inhale means that the sacrum will go into extension. And when you exhale, the sacrum goes into flexion. The other movement that occurs around the axis is cranial motion. So in this lecture, I'm just going to introduce the words, so just memorize the words for now, knowing that during a later lecture that's devoted 100 percent to cranial, we'll go over what everything means. So just remember what I'm writing down on the board. So for cranial, which is also called inherent sacral motion, when the SBS goes into flexion, your sacrum is going to go into extension. And when you're in the world of cranial, sacral extension is also called counternutation. When the SBS goes into extension, the sacrum is going to tip forward into flexion. And this motion in the world of cranial is called nutation. Don't worry about what these mean just yet. We have a lecture devoted all to cranial later in the series. So now that we understand how the sacrum moves, we're now going to go over how do you diagnose the sacrum? So you need three things in order to diagnose the sacrum. You need to know the seated flexion test. You need to know which side has a deep sacral sulcus, and you need to know which side is the posterior inferior ILA. So what do these three findings mean? The seated flexion test is when you have the patient seated on the edge of a chair or edge of a table. You have your thumbs hooked underneath the patient's PSIS, and then they bend forward in the flexion. As they go into flexion and you're monitoring with your thumbs, you take note of which thumb moves first, moves fastest or moves furthest. Whichever side that happens on is what side is dysfunctional for the sacrum. So it's telling you that that side of the sacrum is mobile. And this can either happen on the left side or on the right side. So seated flexion test, it's either positive on the left or positive on the right. Next you have the sacral sulcus. So what you do here is you have the patient laying on their stomach. You palpate the sacral sulcus and you tip your thumbs inward into the sulcus. And what you're doing is feeling for which sacral sulcus is deep and which sacral sulcus is shallow. So you can either have deep or you can have a shallow finding. It's important for you to understand that for the sacral sulcus, you can either have deep or shallow. In order to correctly diagnose the sacrum using our method later, you need to know which side is deep. So if you're given a finding that says that one side is shallow, you need to understand that they're saying that the other side is deep. So if the finding says the right side is shallow, that means that the left side is deep. So always take your findings and reinterpret them back into deep. Now posterior inferior ILA, you march your thumbs down to the ILA. You loop your fingers underneath and you palpate which side is posterior and inferior. For that, you can have two different findings. You can either have a posterior inferior side or you can have an anterior superior side. Just like the sacral sulcus, you need to understand that if you're given one of those findings, you can transfer it to the opposite side. So if they're saying that the right side is anterior and superior, this means that the left side is posterior inferior. And if you want to follow our diagnostic flow, you need to make sure that you're findings are posterior and inferior. So always change back to what findings you need for the dysfunction. So there are two different types of dysfunction that you can have for the sacrum. You can either have a flexion or extension dysfunction, or you can have a torsion dysfunction. So a flexion or extension dysfunction. That just means that the sacrum can flex or can extend. This can either be bilateral or it occurs on the right and the left side, so the entire sacrum tips forward or tips backward into extension, or this can be unilateral where only the right side tips forward or only the left side extends backward. So you can have a bilateral flexion or extension, or you can have a unilateral flexion or extension. Torsions are a little bit different. Torsions can flex around a certain axis or they can extend around a certain axis. The way that we say this to one another is by saying right on right or left on left or right on left or left on right. What this means is we are saying which direction the sacrum is rotated and on what axis it's rotated. You name the rotation based on which direction the sacrum is going. The axis that you're going to use to name the dysfunction is the oblique axis. So remember that you named the oblique axis based on which sacral sulcus you're running through. So right sacral sulcus, right oblique. Left sacral sulcus, left oblique. So there are two types of torsions. You can either have a flexed torsion or a forward torsion, or you can have an extension torsion or a backwards torsion. For flexed torsions, you can have a right on right or a left on left. If we go back to my pen example, let's say that my pen is a sacrum or my hand is a sacrum. If we use my pen as an axis that's oblique through the left side, it's going to run right here. If I'm going into forward rotation, it's going to go anteriorly. So it's going to move like this. You always name the direction of rotation based off which way the sacrum is going. The easiest way to think about this is imagine a set of eyeballs on the front side of the sacrum. When I bend forward around that left axis, my eyeballs are now looking to the left, so I'm rotated to the left. If I'm going into forward torsion around the right axis and I bend forward, my sacral eyeballs are now looking to the right, so it's a right torsion. So now the extension torsions, you can either have a right on left or a left on right. Unlike a flexed torsion, where the sacrum dips forward into flexion, for an extension torsion the sacrum dips backward into extension around that oblique axis. So if you're looking at it from the lateral side, it's going to look like this. If you look at it from the anterior side, it's going to rotate like this, back into extension. You can still name the directionality of rotation based on your sacral eyeballs. If you are rotating around the axis forward, you're rotating to the right. But for an extension dysfunction, if I'm going backwards my eyeballs are now looking to the left, so it's a left rotation. So looking at it from the forward side, going backward is a left rotation. So this next part of the lecture is going to tell you how you can interpret the diagnostic findings to tell you what the diagnosis is. This is outlined so that you don't necessarily have to understand what each finding means, but you just plug it into the flow chart and get the correct diagnosis. All that you have to remember is that it's a mirror and it's same/opposite, same/opposite, flexed, extended, right. You'll see what I mean as I'm going. So seated flexion test. You're going to have two findings. You can either have it positive on the left or positive on the right. And remember, since this is a mirror, we're only going to go over the left side right now. So the next thing that you do is you assess the side of the sacral sulcus and the ILA. Now remember, when you're interpreting the sacral sulcus findings and the ILA findings, you always want to put it into deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA. So if they tell you that one side is shallow, the other side is deep. Or if they tell you one side is anterior superior, the other side is posterior inferior. The next thing that you need to understand is that this can either happen on the right side or on the left side of the sacrum. So you have the findings of the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA on the same side. The deep and posterior inferior ILA are both on the same side. So same, or they can be on the opposite side. The next step that you need to run through is comparing the sacral sulcus in the seated flexion test. So you need to identify which side the sacral sulcus is deep on, and which side the seated flexion test is positive on. They can both either be on the right or on the left. For this side of the equation, if the seated flexion test is on the left and the deep sacral sulcus is also on the left, they're on the same side. If they're both on the same side, then you know you have a left unilateral flexion. If your deep sacral sulcus and positive seated flexion test are on the opposite sides, then that tells you that you have a left unilateral extension. If we move back up the flow chart to deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA occurring on opposite sides of one another, next we look at the deep sacral sulcus and the seated flexion test. If they are both on the same side, for example, the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the deep sacral sulcus is also deep on the left, they're telling you it's on the same side. If this happens, then you have a right on right. If they occur on opposite sides, meaning that the seated flexion test is positive on the left and the deep sacral sulcus is on the right, saying that they are on opposite sides, this tells you that you have a left on right dysfunction. So once again, same/opposite, same/opposite, same/opposite, flex, extended, right. Right because for both of these findings it's on a right oblique axis. And if the first one is right on right, the next one must be left on right. Now here's where the magic happens. I took you through every single step. I told you same/opposite, same/opposite. We went through all the findings. But for the chart, the way that we have it laid out, all you need to do is flip it like it's a big mirror, down the middle. So I can draw this out really quickly by saying seated flexion test's on the right, sacral sulcus reverse ILA, it's a mirror, so I can say this is opposite, this is same. Next we look at the sacral sulcus on the seated flexion test. Of both of these, we can have them being on the same side or the opposite. Because it's a mirror, it's going to be the opposite of the other side. And with our dysfunctions, we're just going to flip it. So we're going to start out with a right on left, then a left on left, then a right unilateral extension and a right unilateral flexion. So you can go through the entire flow chart based on left or right. There's a lot to memorize for the flow chart, and if you get frazzled in an exam, it may be difficult to remember everything. So in the next video, I'm going to show you the way that I do the diagnosis. How you draw it out, and once you understand how the motions are working, not only will you get the questions right on the test but you'll also understand what you're even talking about. So in this lecture, we went over axes of motion for the sacrum, what occurs around each axis, the three findings that you must have to get the sacral diagnosis, flexion and extension and torsion dysfunctions, and then went through the very confusion flow chart, which I made easy by saying same/opposite, same/opposite, same/opposite, flexion, extension, right oblique, right oblique, everything's a mirror. And that is how you diagnose the sacrum. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sacrum Practice and L5 Mechanics]  
﻿In the previous lecture, we discussed how to diagnose the sacrum using that massive flow chart. Same/opposite, flex extended, right axis, everything's a mirror, something like that. You didn't really know what everything meant, you just knew how to take the findings that you were given and run through the flow chart to get the diagnosis. This lecture is going to teach you how to be a good physician. It's going to tell you what the sacrum is actually doing and give you the correct diagnosis, and get you points on the exam, and make it so you don't have to memorize that massive chart. So the easiest way to do this is going to be to run through some practice questions. So you're still going to need the same three findings that you needed in the previous lecture. You need to know what side the seated flexion test is positive on, you need to know which side the deep sacral sulcus is on, and you need to know which side the ILA is posterior inferior on. You also need to remember that if they give you shallow for sacral sulcus, that means that the opposite side is deep. If they give you anterior superior for the ILA, that means that the opposite site is posterior inferior. Make sure that you know how to change both of those findings around to fit the mold. So the first set of questions are going to go over flexion and extension dysfunctions. So as a quick reminder, you can have a left unilateral flexion, a right unilateral flexion, a left unilateral extension and a right unilateral extension. If we're going to use the pen and hand method to show what these motions actually look like, it's going to look like this. So here's your axis. You have your sacrum and you're looking at it from the posterior side. A left unilateral flexion means that the left side of the sacrum is moving forward into flexion. So it'll look like this. A right unilateral flexion means that the right side goes forward. A left unilateral extension means that the left side comes backward into extension, and the right unilateral extension means that the right side comes backward into extension. So left flexion, right flexion, left extension, right extension. So let's do some practice questions. Let's say that you're in the clinic and you palpate on a patient, that they have a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, a deep sacral sulcus on the left, and posterior inferior ILA on the left. So the way that we're going to approach these questions is just to draw everything out. You're going to draw it out, it's going to show you what the sacrum is doing and it's going to give you the diagnosis. So here are your findings. The first thing that you're going to do is draw a sacrum. You're looking at the sacrum from the posterior side. The seated flexion test is positive on the left. The deep sacral sulcus is on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the left. The side that's positive for the seated flexion test is going to be the side of dysfunction. That means that every finding that you have on the left side will be dysfunctional or abnormal. The findings that you have on the right side are the normal findings, so where the sacrum should be. The next step is you can tell the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, posterior inferior ILA is also on the left, so it must be a flexion or extension. So we can draw our pen axis down the midline. So then, if we take our pen, take our hand, do the motions that we have written down, the left side is mobile because that's the positive seated flexion test, and the left side sacral sulcus is deep. So if we're going to do that, I have to push the left side forward into flexion. So this is going to be a left unilateral flexion. The left side is going forward into flexion. Left unilateral flexion. So I got that diagnosis without using the chart. I just drew it. Next question. So question number three, you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the right, the sacral sulcus that's deep on the left, and a posterior inferior ILA that's also on the left. So the first step is going to be to draw out the sacrum and draw your findings. So the seated flexion test is positive on the right. The deep sacral sulcus is on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is also on the left. The deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA on the same side, which tells you it must be a flexion or extension. So you can draw your vertical axis down the middle and figure out motion. So if we're going back to our pen and hand model, it's going to look like this. The right side seated flexion test is positive, so that's the mobile side, that's the abnormal side. That's the dysfunctional side. The left sacral sulcus is deeper than the right sacral sulcus. In order to make that happen, the right side must move backwards into extension. So in order to make the left side deeper, the right side move backward into extension. So that tells you that you have a right unilateral extension. So we got the correct diagnosis, still no chart. So let's say that the seated flexion test is positive on the right, the sacral sulcus is shallow on the right, and the posterior inferior ILA is located on the left. So the first thing that we're going to do is draw out the sacrum. So we're told that the seated flexion test is positive on the right. We're given that the sacral sulcus is shallow on the right. Remember that we need to transfer this finding to tell us which one is deep to follow our pattern. So if it's shallow on the right, that means that the left side is deep. Posterior inferior ILA on the left. So the deep sacral sulcus, posterior inferior ILA on the same side. We can draw our axis. Going back to the hand model, the seated flexion test is positive on the right, that's the abnormal side and that's the side with motion. So we are going to name the dysfunction based on which side is abnormal. So if the right side is mobile but the left side is deeper than the right sacral sulcus, then the right side must move back into extension. So the right side moves into extension, so we have another right unilateral extension. So one more question. We have a sacral sulcus that is deep on the right. We have a posterior inferior ILA that's positive on the right, and we have a spring test that's positive. So what's a spring test? A spring test is going to tell you if the dysfunction is an extension dysfunction or not an extension dysfunction. If your spring test is positive, that means that you have an extension dysfunction. So spring positive means that you have an extension dysfunction. A similar test to the spring test is called the sphinx test. It's similar in that if this test is positive, it's an extension dysfunction. If either of these tests is negative, that means it is not an extension dysfunction. So going back to our question, we're given three set of findings, so we just need to draw out a sacrum and figure out what it means. So we have a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior ILA on the right, and the sacral dysfunction is some sort of extension. So what do we do with this? Well, you know that the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA are on the exact same side, so it must be a flexion or extension. So if we're going to use our pen and hand model, we need to figure out how to make a dysfunction using those findings that gives us something that's in extension. So if the right side is deep, then we must make the left side shallow in order to give us an extension dysfunction. So this motion is a left unilateral extension. You name it a left unilateral extension because the left side was mobile. So now we're going to move on to torsions. So remember for torsions, you had two different types. You had a forward and a backward torsion. So you always name a torsion based on rotation and axis. And this is what's going to delineate between a forward torsion or a flex torsion and a backward torsion or an extension torsion. So for the flex torsions, you have a right on right and a left on left. For an extension torsion or a backwards torsion, you have a left on right and a right on left. Now if we're going to use our hand model to demonstrate what motion this goes into, we can use our pen axis and our hand as a sacrum. If we want to represent a left oblique axis, we need to make sure that the axis goes through the left sacral sulcus like this. If it goes into flexion, that means that the base of the sacrum is anterior, and the rest of the sacrum moves into flexion. This motion is a forward torsion. The base of the sacrum is moving forward. For an extension dysfunction, the sacrum is tipping backwards into extension. So it's coming back towards you or posteriorly. The way that you name the direction of rotation is which way the sacrum is going. Imagine that you have eyeballs on the anterior side of the sacrum, and when it does its rotation that's the way that the sacrum is looking. So in this example with a left oblique axis, if the sacrum moves forward in the flexion, the sacrum is now looking to the left, so it's rotated to the left. This is a forward torsion. If it goes backward into extension, the eyeballs are now looking to the right, so this is now a right on left dysfunction. This is a backward torsion. So forward torsion, left on left, backward torsion, right on left. So now some practice questions with this. So let's say that you had a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, sacral sulcus that's deep on the left and an ILA that's posterior inferior on the right. So what do we do? We're going to do the same thing. We're just going to draw it out. So we're going to draw our sacrum. We're given that the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the right. They're both on the opposite sides of one another, so that tells you it's some sort of torsion dysfunction. It also tells you that the left side is dysfunctional. The left side is mobile and you're going to name everything based off of that. So in order to make the left side mobile, that means that the axis that it rotates around must be through the opposite sacral sulcus. So the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the oblique axis runs through the right sacral sulcus. So at this point you can already fill in half of your diagnosis. You know it's something on a right oblique axis. Right oblique axis, right sacral sulcus. So now you just need to figure out which way the sacrum is rotated. So if you do a hand model, you have your oblique axis to the right, your sacrum is attached to it, the left sacral sulcus is deep. In order to make that happen, you have to dip forward into flexion. And when you go this direction, the eyeballs on the front of your sacrum are now looking to the right. So you have a right rotation on a right oblique axis. Right on right. Next question. So now you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the right. Sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, and a posterior inferior ILA on the left. So how we approach this? Draw it again. So we're going to draw our sacrum. Seated flexion test is positive on the right. You have a deep sacral sulcus on the right, posterior inferior ILA on the left. They're on opposite sides so you know it's some sort of torsion dysfunction, meaning that it must be an oblique axis. You know that the seated flexion test is positive on the right. This is the mobile side, this is the abnormal side. In order for this to be mobile, the oblique axis must run through the opposite sacral sulcus. So that means that the oblique axis will run through the left sacral sulcus. So you have half your diagnosis. It's something on a left oblique axis, left because left sacral sulcus. If we're going to use our hand model to go over what this is, we have a left oblique axis, sacrum goes on it, and in order to make the right side deep, you have to move forward into flexion. When I make this motion, the eyeballs on the front of my sacrum are now looking to the left, so I have a left on left dysfunction. Rotated left, left oblique axis. More questions. So let's say that you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, the sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, and an ILA that's anterior superior on the right. So what are you going to do? You're going to draw it out again. So you're given that the sacral sulcus is deep on the right. You're given that the seated flexion test is positive on the left, and you're given an anterior superior finding for an ILA. So remember, you have to be able to flip that over and tell which side is posterior inferior. So if it's anterior superior on the right, that means it's posterior inferior on the left. They're on opposite sides so you know it's a torsion, so it must have some oblique axis. The seated flexion test is positive on the left, telling you that the left side is dysfunctional and the left side is mobile. And for that to happen, the oblique axis must run through the opposite sacral sulcus. So you already have half the diagnosis. It's something on a right oblique axis. Right because it runs through the right sacral sulcus. If you're going to use a hand model, right oblique axis, sacrum going on it. And remember that the left side is mobile, so the left side is going to be doing the moving. In order to make the finding that the right sacral sulcus is deep, you must make the left sacral sulcus shallow. And in order to do that, you must tip backward into extension. When I tip backward into extension, the eyeballs on the front of my sacrum are now looking to the left, which means that you are rotated left on a right oblique axis. So this is an example of a backwards torsion or an extension torsion. So one more torsion example. Let's say that you have a sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, a posterior inferior ILA that's on the left, and you have a positive spring test. Approach this the exact same way as all the other ones. You draw out your sacrum. You draw on your findings. Deep sacral sulcus on the right, posterior inferior ILA on the left and a positive spring test, which means that it must be some sort of extension dysfunction. So you can put up here, extension dysfunction. So if you stop right here and think about it, it must be some sort of torsion because the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA are on the opposite sides. So the two backwards torsions that we know that go into extension are either a right on left or a left on right. In order to make a backwards torsion or an extension torsion, knowing that the right sacral sulcus is deep, we must make it so that we have an oblique axis on the right and make the left sacral sulcus tip backwards into extension. For us to do that, that means that we have a left on right. So if I'm going to draw that out, it goes into extension, this side is deep, that means this must be shallow, which means that the axis goes here, tips backward into extension. Eyeballs are looking to the left, so it's rotated left on a right oblique axis. So the next portion of this is where the test makers are going to try and have you relate the sacrum to L5. It's really not complicated. You just have to remember a few rules. So rule number one is that L5 flexion and extension occurs on the opposite direction of the sacrum. So if the sacrum is flexed, L5 must be extended. If the sacrum is extended, L5 must be flexed. Next we have rotation. The L5 directionality of rotation is going to be the opposite of the sacrum. So if the sacrum is rotated to the right, L5 must be rotated to the left. If L5 is rotated to the left, sacrum must be rotated to the right. And the final rule, L5 side bending tells you which oblique axis that the sacrum is on. So if L5 is side bent to the right, that tells you that the sacrum is on a right oblique axis. Side bent to the left, you're on a left oblique axis. Three rules, all you have to follow to tell you what L5 is doing in relation to the sacrum. So let's do some questions with it. Let's say that they tell you that L5 is neutral, side bent to the right and rotated to the left. So what do you do? They give you a neutral finding, but the rules are flexion and extension and are now lost. Use the other two rules and you'll still get the correct answer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw out my sacrum just like all the other questions. It's side bent to the right, which means that this is on a right oblique axis. So you already have half of your diagnosis. It's a blank on right. They also tell you that L5 is rotated to the left. Following the rule of L5 in rotation, the sacrum goes in the opposite direction. So if L5 is rotated to the left, that means that the sacrum must be rotated to the right. So your answer is a right rotation on a right oblique axis. Super simple. So final two examples. Let's say that they tell you that you have an L5 that is flexed, side bent to the left and rotated to the left. What's your sacral diagnosis? Draw it out, just like all the other ones. I'm going to draw my sacrum, side bent to the left so it must be a left oblique axis, so blank on left. Rotated to the left, which means that the sacrum must be rotated to the right, so it's a right on left. You can go through these pretty quickly. Right rotation on a left oblique axis. Now the final question. You're going to have to interpret two different findings to get the correct answer. So let's say that they tell you that the seated flexion test is positive on the right, the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the right. What are your L5 findings? So now you got to go backwards. You have to diagnose the sacrum first, then use your sacral rules to find out what L5 is doing. So the first thing that I'm going to do is figure out what the sacral diagnosis is. I'm going to do that by drawing my sacrum. Seated flexion test is positive on the right, sacral sulcus is deep on the left, posterior inferior ILA is on the right. They're on opposite sides so it must be some sort of a torsion dysfunction. And the mobile side is on the right. The dysfunctional side is on the right, which means that the axis must be through the left sacral sulcus. So far, you know the diagnosis is a blank on left because it's a left oblique axis. To make this work, you need to have your left oblique axis, sacrum going forward, the left sacral sulcus is deep, the right side is mobile, so you must move the right side to make it shallow, which means you're tipping backwards into extension. And now your eyeballs are rotated to the right. So you know that you have a right rotation on a left oblique axis. So now you know what the diagnosis of the sacrum is, you got to relate it back to L5. So you use the exact same rules. So you know that L5 is something, side bent in some direction, and rotated in some direction. Side bending occurs on the exact same plane as your axis, so whatever the oblique axis is, is your side bending component for L5. Left oblique axis, it must be left side bending. The other rule is that L5 is rotated the opposite direction of the sacrum. We know that the sacrum is rotated to the right, which means that L5 must be rotated to the left. Now we know that flexion extension occurs in the opposite direction of the sacrum. So if you remember that a right on left torsion is a backwards torsion or an extension torsion, that means that L5 must be flexed. So the answer to this question is L5 flexed, side bent left, rotated left. So we went through a bunch of practice questions to get the answers correct for sacral diagnosis. And in none of these questions did I use that chart that I may or may not remember. So follow this, be able to draw it out, know what the diagnosis is, and you'll be in good shape for the exam and in your clinic as well. And that's my method for diagnosing the sacrum. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Scoliosis and Leg Length v2]  
﻿This lecture is going to be devoted to scoliosis, leg length discrepancies and how the body is going to compensate for these pathologies. Now don't get lost in the weeds trying to figure out how exactly to calculate the Cobb angle and what the rules of bracings are. Don't worry about that for now. We're going to keep this very osteopathic centered. So, to start off with there are two different types of scoliotic curves. You can either have a dextroscoliosis or you can have a levoscoliosis. So, what's the difference? The difference is going to be the directionality that the spine takes. So, for dextroscoliosis it'll look something like this. Dextroscoliosis curves to the right. The convex side is on the right side. One way to remember that this is a dextro curve is it kind of looks like a D when you look at it from the posterior side. So dextro is convex to the right. Levo is going to be the opposite. Levo is convex to the left. Left levo, convex to the left. So, you can have different severities of your scoliosis. You can have a mild scoliosis. You can have a moderate scoliosis, or you can have a severe scoliosis. So how are we going to tell the difference between the scoliotic curves? What's the delineation between mild, moderate and severe? It's going to be the angularity that the spine takes. So, in order to get the angle, you need to calculate the Cobb angle. We're not really going to discuss how exactly you calculate this, but just know that you take the bottom of the spine and compare it to the top of the spine in terms of curve and you're going to calculate the angle. The worst the curve, the higher the angle, the more severe the disease. So, for mild scoliosis, you'll have a Cobb angle between 5 and 15. For moderate, you'll have between 20 and 45 and for severe it'll be an angle above 50. Now if you have a severe enough scoliosis to have an angle above 50, you need to worry about respiratory issues for your patient. And if it's so severe where it's over 75, you need to start worrying about cardiac issues. So, what can you do to help treat your patient with scoliosis? It depends on the severity. For a mild scoliotic curve, you can attempt to use OMM. For moderate, you can begin by using on them, but you really need to start thinking about bracing. And for severe, you definitely need to start thinking about surgery. So there are two different classes of scoliotic curves. You can either have a functional curve, or you can have a structural curve. Now what's the difference between functional and structural? A functional curve when the patient begins to flex, extend, side bend, rotate in some direction the scoliotic curve will not be present anymore. This is called functional. So, when the patient moves it goes away, so away with movement. Structural is going to be the exact opposite. So, no matter what they do, they're always going to have that curve. So, it's just the opposite. No matter which way they move, they're going to keep the curve. So, we mentioned treating using OMM, what exactly are we going to be treating? Well, of course, you're going to look at the spine, but here's the big topic of this lecture, compensation patterns. So the body is always going to try and compensate in order to keep the patient as upright as possible. If the patient has a curve in one direction, it's going to have to compensate by maybe moving the hips, moving the neck, moving the shoulders to keep the patient straight and because of that, they can develop somatic dysfunctions throughout their entire body all because they have a scoliotic curve. So as a visual representation, so as you can see in this artist demonstration, the scoliotic curve will be curved in one direction and the rest of the body will need to compensate by maybe side bending the head, maybe side bending the shoulders as well. It can also move around the innominates in the sacrum as well as the lower extremities. So as you can see the body will compensate in different directions. So, when you're treating the patient who has scoliosis, don't only look at their spine, look at the rest of the body for potential compensation pattern. So, when you're treating, of course, you look at the spine, you can also look at the neck, shoulders, the innominates, the sacrum, the PSOAS and the lower extremity, just to name a few. This isn't a complete list, but just some of the heavy hitters. So now we're going to move our discussion over to leg length discrepancies. So, you can have two different types of leg length discrepancies, two different types of short leg. You can have acquired, and you can have congenital. So, acquired and congenital. So what's the difference? Acquired means that at birth both of your leg lengths are the exact same. So at birth you don't have a short leg. At some point during your life, you're going to develop a somatic dysfunction that causes you to have a short leg. So, you have some sort of issue that causes it. So, some sort of a problem causes the short leg. What could some of these problems be? In some of the previous lessons we already talked about some causes of short leg, but as a reminder you can have a posterior innominate rotation in up-shear of the innominates or a PSOAS dysfunction. So, if you have a patient and you screen them and they have a short leg and you have these findings on your screen that's telling you that a somatic dysfunction is causing their short leg. This is going to be different than congenital. A congenital short leg means that you were born with one leg shorter than the other. So, in congenital you're born with a short leg and because of this you're going to have some problems moving forward. So, if you're born with a short leg the body is going to have to compensate, just like it did for scoliosis. It's going to do what it can to keep the body as straight as possible that can either be attempting to elongate the leg or it could be moving your body into a certain way so that you stay as straight as possible. So, some of these findings that can be a compensatory pattern towards a congenital short leg would be an anterior innominate rotation or a down-shear with your innominates. So, if you see a patient who has a congenital short leg, which you would know from their history or from their chart. These are the findings that you would see, because the body is compensating. Other findings that you can have for a compensated congenital short leg would be an inferior sacral base on the side of the short leg and your lumbar spine may be convex on the side of the short leg. Remember the body is going to try and compensate to keep you as straight as possible. Now here's the key to this. There's a difference on your findings between acquired and congenital. If you have an acquired short leg, these are the findings that are going to cause it and what you'll see on the screen. Congenital is someone born with the short leg. These are the findings that you're going to see on the screen as compensation. So, keep these two separate. Now if they have a congenital short leg, you can treat that using heel lifts. So, when you use a heel lift, your heel if is going to be 1/8th of an inch and you are going to increase by 1/8th of an inch every two weeks. So, the reason that you don't give it all back at once is because the body compensation patterns. The body is a big tensegrity unit. If you treat the leg length discrepancy all at once, then you're going to throw off the rest of the body with all the other compensation patterns. Now you can use 1/8th heel lift for a normal young healthy patient, but if they are elderly you need to start at 1/16th heel lift and increase by 1/16th every two weeks. So, imagine as granny is not as spry as the college kid, so you can't be treating granny the same way that you treat a young person. So, the way that you're going to treat elderly is go low and even slower. Now if they have some sort of trauma, you can give it all back at once. Now what do I mean by trauma? The patient had surgery or if they're in a motor vehicle collision and all of a sudden they come out of it with a short leg, because they're missing part of their tibia or part of their femur, you're allowed to give all of that leg length back at once. That's because there has been no time for the body to compensate. It's been too short of an interval between the damage and the rest of the compensation. So you can give it all back at once to avoid compensation patterns. So, in this lecture we went over scoliotic curves and how to name them based on directionality. We went over the severity scales, how to treat it. Different compensation patterns that you can see, and we also went over leg length discrepancies. Make sure that you keep straight acquired versus congenital and your structural findings. That is the OMM for scoliosis and leg length discrepancies. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Scoliosis and Leg Length]  
﻿This lecture is going to be devoted to scoliosis and leg length discrepancies. And you can really get lost in the weeds by trying to learn how to calculate the Cobb angle and figure out the exact reasons for why one leg is longer than the other, and yada yada yada. We're going to keep this focused on what you need to know for the osteopathic side of things and how you can help your patients if they have scoliosis or some leg length discrepancy. So we're going to start off with naming scoliotic curves. There are two scoliotic curves that you can have. If it's convex to the right, this will be a dextroscoliosis. This is also the most common kind of scoliosis. If it's convex to the left, it's a levoscoliosis. Left, levo. So what does this look like? If I'm going to draw out a dextroscoliosis, your vertebra will look something like this. Maybe not as intense of a curve, but something like this. The convex side is the curvy side. We have it pointing to the right, so this is a dextroscoliosis. If it were pointing to the left, it would be levo. One way that you can tell that this is dextroscoliosis, if you can't remember convex and what direction, this kind of looks like a D from the posterior side. So what about the severity of scoliotic curves? So there are three different classifications that you need to know. You can have mild, you can have moderate, and you can have severe. So how do we calculate these different severities? How do we know? Well, it's going to be the angle of the curve. And how we're going to calculate that is by using the Cobb angle. We're not going to go over the exact mechanism how to calculate the Cobb angle, just remember that you take the angle of the top of the curve and the bottom of the curve and this is going to give you the angle of severity. So on our chart, a mild severity angle will be 5 to 15 degrees. Moderate severity will be 20 to 45, and severe will be greater than 50. If you have a curve of greater than 50, you need to start worrying about respiratory issues. And if someone has a very severe curve above 75 degrees, you need to start thinking about cardiac issues. So what are we going to do to treat these dysfunctions? It's going to change depending on the severity. So if you have a mild scoliotic curve, you can treat it with OMM. So what exactly am I treating? You can be treating the spine for flexion, extension, side bending and rotation dysfunctions. What about for moderate? Well, moderate you can use OMM, but you also need to start thinking about bracing. Not going to go into the details about bracing, just know that as you move down the scale, you need to start doing more treatments than just OMM alone. Once you get down to the severe category, this is when you start needing to think about surgery. You can also have two different types of curves. You can have a functional scoliotic curve and a structural scoliotic curve. For functional, this means that as the patient is moving their spine, as they start to rotate, side bend, and even flex and extend throughout normal motion, the curve seems to go away. So as they curve towards the lesion or towards the curve, then the curve will start to be less noticeable. This is known as a functional scoliotic curve. So away with motion. So you can also have what's called a structural scoliosis. This is basically the opposite of functional, where it doesn't go away no matter how the patient moves. So doesn't go away. So bringing this back to an osteopathic focus, what about treatment for the patient? Well, if you're going to treat with OMM, you certainly need to look at the spine. But then here's where the main concept of this lecture comes in. You need to understand something about compensation. Now the body always wants to try and stand up as straight as possible. But if the patient has a curve in one direction, the body doesn't want them to be walking around with a curve, it wants to compensate so that they can try and stay as straight as possible. This compensation pattern is going to cause numerous dysfunctions throughout the body. It's going to look something like this, where imagine the patient has a scoliotic curve, but the rest of the body is going to need to compensate in order to stand up straight. So the innominates will have to move around. The lower extremities will have to move around. Even the shoulders might have to move around. So with this artist's rendering of common compensation patterns, you can see that because the curve is in one direction, the shoulders are going to have to compensate in the other, the neck is going to have to compensate in another direction, the pelvis is going to have to compensate, and even the lower extremity will have to compensate. This is all to make the body stand up as straight as possible. The primary points that you can think about are going to be your innominates and your shoulders. The big deal that you need to understand is that they cannot compensate in the same direction. If they compensate in the same direction, the patient won't be able to stand up straight. So you see if the spine is to the right, the shoulders are going to have to compensate to the left, while the innominates are going to compensate the opposite direction from the shoulders by going to the right. So the compensatory pattern is opposite going up and down the body. So when you're performing your OMM treatments, you need to be looking at different portions of the body in order to treat the entire patient. So not only do you need to be looking at the spine, you can also look at the neck, shoulders, the psoas, innominates, the sacrum, and the lower extremity. So you need to treat the entire patient, so you need to look at all of the common compensatory areas in order to do so. So shifting gears from scoliosis, we're going to talk about leg length discrepancies. So imagine that you have a patient who comes in whose one leg may be a little bit longer than the other, or one leg's a little bit shorter than the other. Their whole body is going to have to compensate in order to keep everything upright. So the same idea is going to hold true as in scoliosis. The body still needs to compensate, but the cause is different. Instead of scoliosis, it's going to be a leg length discrepancy. So you can have two different types of leg length causes. You can have congenital, which someone is born with, or you can have acquired. So what are some examples of acquired leg length discrepancies? Think back to some of the lower extremity and pelvis lectures that we talked about, and you can think of some of the reasons that would cause some discrepancies. Some causes of a short leg can be a posterior innominate rotation. So remember, for a posterior rotation, the pelvis is rotated posteriorly and it's going to pull all of the bones of the lower extremity up, and that's going to cause a short leg. Now imagine an up shear. You have a pelvic up shear, one of the innominates are moving up, which is then going to pull all of the bones of the lower extremity up with it, thus causing a short leg. And finally, psoas. If the psoas is hypertonic and it's causing flexion, side bending and rotation towards one side, the rest of the body is going to need to compensate, and to do that it's going to pull this leg upward and you're going to have a short leg on that side. So what about some causes for long leg? As you can imagine, they're probably going to be the opposite of short leg. So you can have an anterior innominate rotation. Remember, when you rotate anteriorly, the bones of the lower extremity will be pushed downward. And you can have a down shear. When the innominate is pushed downward, it will push the rest of the bones of the lower extremity downward, thus causing a long leg. So how about treatment? The first thing that you can look at doing is OMM. If it's some sort of acquired discrepancy, you can just treat the dysfunction like we went over in previous lectures. You know how to treat innominate rotations and you know how to treat shears. You also know how to treat the psoas. So just do that and you can potentially treat the leg length discrepancy. But if that doesn't work, you want to start thinking about heel lifts. Now as we discussed earlier, if the patient has a short leg, the rest of the body is going to compensate for that. You're going to have compensatory patterns throughout the body. When you're treating with a heel lift, you can't just give everything back all at once, because the rest of the body is still compensated. So even if you fix the leg length discrepancy, they're still going to have pelvic dysfunctions, shoulder dysfunctions, neck dysfunctions, everything. So you need to start slow and work your way forward. So you start out with a one-eighth inch heel lift. You increase this by one-eighth of an inch every two weeks. This is a little bit different for elderly individuals. For elderly, you're going to start with a one-sixteenth inch heel lift. Now think about it this way. Granny is not as spry as a college kid, so the body compensatory patterns will take a little bit longer to adjust to changes. So if you give them one-eighth of an inch heel lift, the rest of the body may not catch up as quickly as someone in college. So start even lower and go even slower. So you'll start out with a one-sixteenth heel left and you'll do the same, where you increase every two weeks. Now this is different for trauma cases. So in this example, by trauma I really mean fracture. Let's say if the patient has a femoral fracture, he has to go into the operating room and have it repaired. When he comes out, he now has some sort of leg length discrepancy after the repair. If that's the case, the body has not had time to compensate and you can give them their entire discrepancy back in a shoe lift. This is okay because since the rest of the body has not had time to compensate, if you start out slow and work you way slowly up, the body will have to compensate. But if you just give them their entire discrepancy all at once, then the body will remain normal as it has been. So in this lecture we went over scoliotic curves, the different severity types, really had to focus on different compensatory patterns and common areas that you can find compensation, and then we went over leg length discrepancies and shoe lifts. And that's OMM for scoliosis and leg length. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sequenced Structural Exam]  
﻿At this point you have many bits and pieces of osteopathy floating around your brain. You know how to diagnose the sacrum, screen for Chapman's points and even figure out something with the autonomics, but what you don't know is how to put all of these pieces together for your patient on the PE and in the clinic. You simply don't have enough time to perform every assessment on every patient. Here we're going to discuss a screening tool that you can use on every patient every time that can then help you dial in on the area of dysfunction and then you can rapidly screen and treat. So, the name of this exam is called the Sequenced Structural Exam. In some schools this is called the style screen named after the creator Dr. Styles. There are two portions of this exam. You start off with screening the spine. Now when you screen the spine, you're going to do this on every patient every time. this is the tier 1 portion of this screen. Tier 1 because you do it on every patient every time. When you perform the spinal screen, it's then going to give you an idea of which areas of the body are dysfunctional. When you know which areas of the body are dysfunctional, you can then perform a focused exam on that area, which will be your Tier 2 screen. So, the second step is your focused exam, which will be your Tier 2 exam. So, you're going to perform the spinal screen on every patient every time that's going to give you an area of dysfunction, then you can perform your focus Tier 2 exam on that specific area. So, what exactly are you looking for? The Tier 1 screen is going to identify areas of restriction. The areas of restriction are then going to tell you which portions of the body are dysfunctional. You're going to perform the exam from the occiput all the way down to the SI joint. Whichever area is dysfunctional could potentially tell you the areas of the body that you need to do a focused exam on. So, what are the mechanics of how the screen works? It's type 3 mechanics. If you recall back from one of the early lessons, we discussed Fryette's three laws. The third law discussed stacking and it said that the further that you move into one plane of motion, like flexion the less you can move into side bending and even less you can move into rotation. We're going to use this idea during our spinal screen to assess for areas of dysfunction. We're going to use both hands to perform this stacking exam. One hand, we're going to call the director and the other hand we're going to call the lever. Now don't get too tripped up on the names of the hands. They just help you remember what the hand does. So, the director hand is going to induce two planes of motion, the flexion and the side bending component. The lever hand is going to induce the rotational component. So, you put both of them together to get all three planes of motion. We're going to flex forward side bend to one side and then rotate to that exact same side thus stacking all of your motions. So, your director hand is going to flex and side bend toward whatever side that you're going to be screening and the lever hand is going to rotate towards the side of side bending. So, if you're drawing this out, the director hand is going to flex and side bend to the right. The lever hand is going to push laterally on the spinous processes to induce rotation towards the same side of side bending. So how exactly are you going to perform this exam? You're going to screen the patient from the occiput to the SI joint bilaterally. So, you can start on the left or you can start on the right. We are going to perform the stacking with the patient first standing and then in a seated position. This entire Tier 1 portion of the screen shouldn't take more than 30 seconds, but it's the most important step. It gives you where the areas of dysfunction are. So after you perform the standing and seated portion, so once that you performed the exam with the patient standing and then with the patient seated, you need to assess if the areas of restriction are still in the same locations, if the patient is standing or if the patient is seated. So, is it the same? If it is the same, the next step is going to be to assess the location. There are three different locations that you can find these areas of restriction. It can either be above C7 or at C7. It can be somewhere in the thoracic spine or it can be at or below L1. If it's at or above C7, this is telling you that you have a cervical dysfunction. So just to catch up, you've done your Tier 1 screening exam. You've assessed the patient's spine. Now you know that the area of greatest restriction is in the cervical spine. This now tells you that you can perform your focused Tier 2 exam in the cervical spine. So, some of those exams that you can perform are to assess for cranial motion. Look at the OA at the AA and look at C2 through C7. Now if the location was somewhere in the T-spine, this tells you that you have a thoracic dysfunction. Now it's not as easy for a thoracic dysfunction as it is for cervical. You now need to assess the patterns that you palpated the areas of restriction. So, the next step is to assess the patterns. So, the area of great restriction patterns. There are three different patterns that you can palpate in the thoracic spine. The first pattern will be when you're palpating the spine in the thoracic area, at one vertebral segment bilaterally you feel a dysfunctional area. So, as you flex side bend and rotate the patient as you're palpating, you feel an area of restriction on both sides of the spine. This area of restriction is worse at the spine but gets better the further that you move lateral. This is going to tell you that you have a vertebral dysfunction. So, you've now performed your Tier 1 exam of the spine. You now know that the area of greatest restriction is in the T-spine, you now know that it is in a vertebral segment. Now you can perform your focused Tier 2 exam and for that we already went over in some of the previous lessons to diagnose a vertebral segment of T-spine, you just assess for flexion and extension, side bending and rotation. Another area of great restriction pattern that you can palpate is it going to be the opposite of vertebra. When you palpate the spine at one vertebral segment on both sides, you're going to notice the area of restriction gets worse the further lateral that you move. If you palpate this, this is telling you that you have a rib dysfunction and remember from the previous lessons, you already know how to diagnose and treat the ribs. So, you'll have the patient inhale and exhale and monitor for rib motion. Don't forget that if it's a group dysfunction remember the BITE mnemonic to find the key rib. Now there's a third pattern that you can palpate in a thoracic spine. When you palpate the spine, you're going to feel a unilateral band that extends multiple vertebral segments. If you palpate this finding, it's going to tell you that you have an upper extremity dysfunction. So now you can perform your Tier 2 focused exams on the upper extremity. This can include screening the scapula, the SC joint, the AC joint, the shoulder, the radial head, the wrist and the hand. Basically, use your screening tools for something in the upper extremity. Now that you've performed your Tier 1 exam, you know that your Tier 2 exam should be somewhere in the upper extremity, you don't have to waste time looking at the patient's lower extremity. Now if your area of restriction is at or below L1, this is telling you that you have a lower body dysfunction. If the area of restriction is at or below your L1, it's a lower body dysfunction or if your areas of restriction were different when the patient was standing and seated. So, when you perform the Tier 1 exam when the patient is standing wherever the area of greatest restriction is, you just make note of it. When they are seated and you perform the Tier 1 exam again, if that location is different that automatically tells you that it is some sort of lower dysfunction. So, if it's a lower dysfunction the next step is to assess if the AGR is at the SI joint or not. If the area of greatest restriction is at the SI joint, this tells you that you have some sort of SI dysfunction. Now what two structures have already gone over that articulate at the SI joint, the innominates and the sacrum and you already know how to screen for both of these dysfunctions. So, remember for the innominates you perform a standing flexion test and to screen the sacrum you perform a seated flexion test. Now if the area of greatest restriction isn't at the SI joint, but is still somewhere in the lower body, that means that you have a lumbar dysfunction. Now just like the thoracic spine, you're going to have some different area of great restriction patterns that you need to be able to interpret in the lumbar spine. So, in the lumbar spine, there are two different AGR patterns that you need to remember. In this first pattern when you're palpating the lumbar spine, you feel an area of restriction bilaterally in the same vertebral segment. If you feel this that means you have a vertebral dysfunction. Now remember from the lumbar lesson the diagnostic exam is the exact same as a thoracic spine. So, you're going to assess for flexion extension, side bending and rotation. The second AGR pattern that you can notice when screening the spine is that unilaterally you feel a band that extends multiple vertebral segments. If you palpate this, this is telling you that you have a lower extremity dysfunction. There are many dysfunctions in the lower extremity that you know how to screen already, some of them include the knee, the fibular head, a tibial rotation, an ankle dysfunction or something down in the foot. So, over this lesson we've talked about how you can perform a Tier 1 screening exam on every patient every time just by looking at the spine. This Tier 1 shouldn't take more than 30 seconds. Once that you do that, it'll give you areas of restriction that you can then note the patterns of and perform your focused Tier 2 exams to figure out which area is dysfunctional and how to best treat your patient. This will help you a lot in the PE when you're crunched for time and you still need to screen your patient, but this can also be very beneficial in the clinic as well and that's OMM: Sequenced Structural Exam. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Shoulder]  
﻿We're now going to begin our talks about the upper extremity and some of the dysfunctions you can find there. We have this divided into three separate lectures, and this will be the first one. We're going to talk about dysfunctions of the shoulder area. So we're going to include the AC joint, the SC joint, the scapula in general and adhesive capsulitis. So we're going to go ahead and start off with the AC joint. Now the AC joint is the acromioclavicular joint. So this is where the clavicle on the lateral side attaches to the acromion. So clavicle to the acromion. What does this joint do? This joint really helps move the scapula around and keep all the structures in the area stable. If the AC joint is dysfunctional, then you're going to have some sort of immobility or some sort of instability in the area. You may even notice this in the scapula region, which is what we're going to use as our diagnostic finding. So keep stable and level scapula. So how do we make our diagnosis? You're going to do what's called a spring test or a compression test. It's where you're going to place your hands over the patient's AC joint and you're going to spring downward. And you're also going to compress. You're going to do this on both sides and you're going to assess which joint is dysfunctional. You're going to tell that by which joint has a hard in feel, which joint just isn't moving properly when you're springing or when you're compressing. That tells you which side is dysfunctional. So to diagnose, do the spring or the compression test to tell dysfunction. Let's say you have that, the next thing you're going to have to do is measure the spines of the scapula. So you're going to go around to the posterior side of the patient and you're going to take both of your thumbs and measure which spine of the scapula is where. For a dysfunction, one of the spines of the scapula may be elevated and one may be depressed. You always name it based on the dysfunctional side. So in this example, let's say that you had a right dysfunctional AC joint, and you notice that the right scapula is higher than the left. That means that you have a right superior AC joint dysfunction. So the next step is to measure the scapular spine. So what do we do about treating this? It's actually pretty simple. Both treatments are exactly the same as one another, there's just a slight tweak if it's inferior or superior. What you do is you're going to perform a muscle energy technique. You're going to have the patient seated and you're going to ask them to AB duct their arm all the way out. The physician is going to go behind the patient, place his knee on the table underneath the arm, so that the patient cannot push his arm downward. During the muscle energy treatment, the patient's isometric force will be pulling his arm down towards the table. He won't be able to go down towards the table because the physician's knee is in the way. To further engage the barrier, the patient is going to raise his arm up while the physician lifts his knee up higher. The treatment difference is all about where the hand is. If it's a superior dysfunction, you have the patient supinate their hand. If it's an inferior dysfunction, you have the patient pronate their hand. So you can remember superior supinate, or if the scapula is elevated, you put the palm up. So to write that out, we have superior dysfunction, you're going to supinate the hand and the patient is going to try and pull his arm down towards the table. If it's an inferior dysfunction, you're going to have the patient pronate his hand but you're still going to have him try and pull his arm down. So this is how you perform the muscle energy technique to treat the AC joint. Superior, inferior. So next we move over to the SC joint. So the SC joint is the sternoclavicular joint. It's where the sternum and the clavicle attach. You can palpate this area by this notch right at the top of your sternum, and you have one on both sides. So the SC joint is where the sternum connects with the clavicle. Now what does this joint do? It really helps keep everything stable as you're moving your upper extremity. When you're shrugging your shoulders, the joint will move inferiorly. When you're moving your shoulders forward, the joint will accommodate by moving posteriorly. So we're going to assess this joint by its motions. So one of the primary motions is the SC joint moves downward when shrugging shoulders. So it moves downward in relation to the rest of the anatomy of the upper extremity. When I shrug, the lateral side of the shoulder is up while the SC joint is located down. So what happens when it's dysfunctional? We use some of the concepts that we talked about from the earlier lectures. Dysfunctional is just abnormal motion of anatomy. So if the normal motion is moving downward when shrugging your shoulders, the dysfunction will be it will not be able to move like this. We're going to use this to get our diagnosis. So what we do is we go behind the patient, we palpate the SC joint bilaterally, and we have the patient shrug their shoulders. We then assess which joint doesn't move properly. Once we've figured out which one doesn't move properly, that's the side of dysfunction. The next thing that we do is we measure the height of the SC joint. So we can place our fingers on both sides bilaterally and tell which SC joint is superior and which one is inferior. You always name it off of the dysfunctional side. So if the right side is dysfunctional, and when you measure it's lower down, that means that you have a right inferior SC joint. So the second step is to measure your SC joint. So how do we treat this? So we're also going to treat this with muscle energy, but it's not going to be as easy as the AC joint. There are two completely different techniques that you need to do. So for a superior SC dysfunction, you're going to use subclavius during your muscle energy technique. So how are you going to engage this muscle? What barrier are you going to put the patient into? You're going to have the patient seated and you're going to have them move their arm backward into extension. Their isometric force will be trying to punch forward. The physician will be holding the patient's wrist and making sure that they cannot punch forward. When you're engaging the barrier, you go further into extension with the arm. So arm back is the barrier, and punching forward is the isometric force that you have the patient do. So that's how you treat the superior SC joint. Now we're going to talk about inferior. If the SC joint is inferior, you're going to use the sternocleidomastoid muscle, so the SCM. The idea of using this muscle is that it's attached to the SC joint, and when you engage it, it's going to help pull the SC joint back up where it should be. So what's the treatment position for this? You're going to engage the barrier by having the patient rotate away from the side of dysfunction. So if the SC joint is inferior on the right, the patient's going to rotate to the left. His isometric force is going to be side bending towards the side of dysfunction. The physician is going to hold the patient's head still as he tries to move into side bending towards. That causes the isometric force. So the barrier is rotate away, and the force is going to be side bend toward. Now remember, after every single technique, whether it's muscle energy or myofascial or anything else, you always have to reassess for treatment efficacy. So after the treatment, reassess by palpating the SC joint when shrugging the shoulders. The next part of this lecture we're going to talk about the scapula. The scapula is the massive bone on the posterior side of your shoulder region. Scapula can move in many different directions. It can elevate, it can depress, it can go into protraction moving forward, it can come into retraction when moving backward. So really it just moves everywhere. So what are we going to see in a dysfunction? Well, the patient will have an abnormal function of anatomy. So it won't be moving properly when the patient is doing something with his upper extremity. That's how you're going to get the diagnosis, lack of movement. So how do you treat it? You can really do just about anything to treat this if you're doing a myofascial technique. You just have to remember whether you want to do a direct technique or an indirect technique. So remember, if you're doing a direct technique for myofascial, you push the scapula where it does not want to go. You're engaging the barrier of the scapula. And if you're doing an indirect technique, you want to push it towards the freedom, where you push it where it can go. So we're going to wrap this up with adhesive capsulitis. So adhesive capsulitis is just a fancy way of saying a frozen shoulder. So when you have frozen shoulder, you're going to have restriction in some sort of movement plane of your shoulder, whether it be flexion, extension, AB duction, AD duction, whatever. The way that you're going to treat this is exactly the same, no matter what the dysfunction is. This is where you're going to use the seven stages of Spencer. So if you remember from your time at school, the seven stages of Spencer is kind of difficult to remember. So there's some pneumonics that go around from school to school. One school uses something about an ice cream cone that I don't know, but the pneumonic that I use and also happens to go pretty well for online med ed, is every fine cat takes an indoor piss. Every fine cat takes an indoor piss. So what does that mean? For this treatment, it's muscle energy. You need to engage different barriers throughout your treatment. So each of these letters represents a different barrier that you're going to engage during treatment. So the first barrier is the extension. Then you move into flexion, then you do compression with circumduction. The next step is traction with circumduction. Then you move into AB duction, abduction, then AD duction with external rotation. The next step is going to be internal rotation, and the final step is going to be the pump. So kind of difficult to remember. Just pick a pneumonic and stick with it. So how is this likely going to show up on an exam question? They're not necessarily going to ask you to diagnose adhesive capsulitis because it's so easy, but the question may say, what are you going to use to treat it? Answer, seven stages of Spencer. The question could say that they're going through the seven stages of Spencer, they've already done internal rotation, what's the next step? You got to remember the steps, and the answer is pump. So just remember the pneumonic, you'll get the question right. You can probably use this to treat some patients, too. So this is the end of the first lecture of the shoulder area. We went over the AC joint, the SC joint, the scapula, and the seven stages of Spencer for adhesive capsulitis. And that's OMM of the shoulder region. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Thoracic Spine Diagnosis]  
﻿As an osteopath, one of the first things that you learn is how to diagnose a thoracic spine. Not only is this important for the clinic and for your exams, but this also lays the foundation for everything else in the rest of this course. So to start off with, we're going to go over some very basic landmark anatomy to make the diagnosis. And the first thing that you need to understand is where the three important landmarks are. You have the body, you have the transverse process and you have the spinous process. So this is what it'll look like from a lateral view, and if you're looking from the top down you're going to see something like this, where this is the body, this is the transverse process, and this is the spinous process. It's important to know where these three are, because the body tells you which direction the vertebral segment is rotated, the transverse process is what you palpate to assess for rotation, and the spinous process is what you palpate to tell which vertebral segment you are at. So the next thing that you need to understand is the rule of threes. And the rule of threes are a set of guidelines that tell you where you are in the spinal column. Each spinous process comes out at a different angle, depending on what level of the spine you are at. So for T1, 2 and 3, the spinous process comes out directly posterior or directly horizontal. So it's at the same level that the vertebral body is. It's at the same level as the transverse process. So if you're looking at it from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this. The spinous process is going to be on the same level as the transverse process. So as you move further down the spine to T4, 5, and 6, the spinous processes are going to come out at a little bit of an angle. They're going to go down half of the level. So if you're looking at this from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this, where the spinous process comes out half of a level below the vertebral body. So this is important because if I'm trying to palpate the transverse process of T5, I need to find the spinous process, march my fingers up half of a level and then palpate horizontally to find the transverse processes. So the next three, T7, 8 and 9, come out one full level below. So they're going to look like this. If you're looking at it from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this, where the spinous process goes down one full segment. So if I'm palpating the spinous process of T8 and I move my thumbs horizontally, I'm going to be palpating the transverse processes of T9. If you need to palpate the transverse process of T8, you need to find the spinous process, move up one full level, and then go horizontally. On exam questions, they may say you palpate the spinous process of T8 and then to the sides of it you palpate the transverse processes, they're telling you that this is T9. So for the last three, you take the other rule of threes and you flip it. So for T10, it follows the same rules as T7 through 9. For T11, it follows the same rules as T4 through 6, and for T12, it follows the same rules as 1 through 3. So now that you know which vertebral segment you're at, you need to be able to name a dysfunction. And there are three components that go into naming a dysfunction. You have the flexion and extension component, you have the rotation, and you also have the side bending. So for an example diagnosis, let's say that you have T6 and it is flexed, rotated right and side bent to the right. So remember, you always name the dysfunction by what it can do. So this says that T6 can flex normally, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. So for each plane of motion, you can have only certain movements. So you can have either a flexed, extended or neutral dysfunction. Rotation you can either have a right rotation or a left rotation, and for side bending you can either be side bent to the right or side bent to the left. So now once you know the motion, now you need to find out how to make the diagnosis. So the first thing that you do is assess for rotation in neutral. So how do I assess for rotation? So what you're going to do is you're going to take your thumbs and you are going to come to the posterior side and you're going to palpate the transverse process of each vertebral segment. Depending on how deep your thumbs go in will tell you what direction the spine is rotated. So if both thumbs are level, that means that that vertebral body is not rotated. If your left thumb goes in deeper, that means that you're rotated to the right. And if your right thumb goes in deeper, that means that you're rotated to the left. So drawing it out, if you have a right rotation it's going to look something like this. And now when I'm palpating the transverse processes, my right thumb doesn't go in very far but my left thumb goes in pretty deep. So this tells me that it's rotated to the right. The way that you name the rotation is which direction the vertebral body is looking. So the vertebral body is looking to the anterior side to the right. So this tells you it is a right rotation. So once you have the rotation component, the next thing that you need to do is assess for rotation during flexion. And when you do this there are two outcomes that you can have. It can either get better in flexion, meaning that when you're palpating in flexion the rotation goes away, or both of your thumbs are now even, or the rotational component doesn't get any better or gets worse. Remember, you have to name it by what it can do. So if the segment gets better in flexion, it can go into flexion, that means that it's a flex dysfunction. Now if it doesn't get better in flexion, the next thing that you're going to need to do is assess during extension. So you're going to do the same thing. You're going to ask the patient to puff their chest out, extend to the vertebral level, and you're going to assess for rotation on the transverse process. Two things can happen here. It can either get better during extension, meaning that the rotational component during extension goes away and both of your thumbs are even, or it can get worse or not change during extension. Once again, if it gets better during extension, that means that it can do extension. So that means that you have some sort of extended dysfunction. If it doesn't get better during flexion and it doesn't get better during extension, that means that you have a neutral dysfunction. In real life, you're going to have to assess for rotation and flexion extension maybe a few times to be able to really tell if it's better during flexion or better during extension. On the exam, they're just going to tell you it gets better during flexion, it gets worse during extension, so you can figure out if it's a flex or extended dysfunction. So now that you have two components of flexion and extension or neutral and rotation, the final thing that you need to do to make the diagnosis is assess for side bending. And the way that we're going to do that is by using Fryette's laws. Now Fryette's laws are a set of rules that tell you which direction the vertebral segment is side bent during flexion, extension or neutral. So type 1 says that during neutral, rotation and side bending occur in opposite directions. So one easy way to remember this is if you draw your N, you put arrows on both sides, they're going in opposite directions. So side bending in rotation occur in opposite directions. Type 2 tells you about flexion and extension. This rule says that during rotation and side bending of a flexed or extended dysfunction, they both occur in the same direction. Easy way to remember this is to put arrows on your letters. So they're all going in the same direction, meaning that if it's a flexed or extended dysfunction, rotation and side bending both occur in the same direction. Now there is a third rule, and it's about stacking. It doesn't necessarily help you with making the diagnosis, but it is important to know. What this says is that during the three planes of motion, flexion, extension, side bending, rotation, the range of motion that you go in one direction will limit the range of motion in the other three. So the more that I flex forward, the less I'm going to be able to rotate and the less I'm going to be able to side bend. So stacking. Not very useful to make the dysfunctional diagnosis, but so important to know. So now that you know the side bending component using Fryette's laws, the rotational component and the flex sticks under the neutral component, you now have your diagnosis. And the easiest way to go over this is to go through some practice questions. So let's say you're taking the exam and it says that in neutral, you palpate that the patient is rotated to the left. It gets better in flexion, meaning that your fingers become more level during flexion. It gets worse in extension, and it doesn't really tell you anything about side bending. So what's the diagnosis? So you know that it gets better in flexion, and if you go through the flow chart, you know that it must be a flex dysfunction. So let's say this is T6 flexed, they told you that it is rotated to the left, so rotated to the left, and using Fryette's second law for a flexion dysfunction, that tells you that rotation and side bending are in the same direction. So you know that it's rotated left, which means that this is also side bent to the left. So another practice question. Let's say that they tell you during neutral you're rotated to the left. The rotational segment doesn't get better during flexion and does not get better during extension. And they also don't tell you what the side bending is doing. So what's the diagnosis? So let's say we're at T6 again. They give you that it's rotated in neutral to the left. So if we start here, it doesn't get better during flexion or extension, so we know it's a neutral dysfunction. So you can write down neutral. Using Fryette's first law, neutral dysfunction, rotation and side bending are in opposite directions. They tell you that you're rotated to the left, so you can do rotated left, side bent to the right. And that'll be your diagnosis for that. Next question. Let's say that they don't tell you anything about rotation, but they do tell you about side bending and they say you're side bent to the right. They say that it gets better during extension and gets worse during flexion. So what's the diagnosis? So this question shows that really, you can flip this flow chart backwards if you need to. If you're given side bending and not rotation, you can still run through the flow chart. You can also still use Fryette's laws and work backwards. So if it's a neutral dysfunction, side bending and rotation are still opposite. So for this dysfunction, let's say it's T6 again, side bending to the right that gets better in extension. So it's an extended dysfunction. Since it's an extended dysfunction, we can follow Fryette's second law saying that rotation and side bending are in the same direction. And we know that it's side bent to the right. So we're rotated to the right and side bent to the right. So for the last practice question, let's say that they tell you during neutral you're rotated to the right. They don't tell you anything about flexion and they don't tell you anything about extension. But they tell you that side bending occurs to the left. So what do you do? So it doesn't get better in flexion or extension, so you know it must be a neutral dysfunction. You can double check yourself because rotation and side bending occur in different directions, which is a Type 1 mechanic rule. So T6 neutral, rotated to the right and side bent to the left. So during this lecture we went over how to palpate the landmarks that are important for your diagnostic findings, the rule of threes that tells you where you are in the spinal column, as well as the relation of the spinous process and transverse process, how to name a thoracic diagnosis, Fryette's laws of how to find side bending, whether it's a neutral, flex or extended dysfunction, your diagnostic flow chart, and a couple of practice questions. And that's how you diagnose the thoracic spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Thoracic Spine Facet Model]  
﻿In the previous video, we talked about how to diagnose the thoracic spine using palpatory findings of the transverse process. In this video, we're going to talk about how to diagnose the thoracic spine using the facet model. In real life, there's really no difference to use either the facet model or the transverse process model. There's no difference. In real life, it's really just up to what you feel more comfortable with, using the transverse process or using the facets. But on an exam, you're still going to be held accountable for knowing what each finding means for both models. So we're going to go through the facet model here. So the first thing that you need to understand is where the facets are. So the facets are bony articulations between each level of the vertebrae. So if you have vertebra number 1 and vertebra number 2, where they touch is where the facets are, and that's how they move on one another. If you're making the palpation, they're located between the spinous process and the transverse process. So if you're going to draw this out, it's going to look something like this, where this is the transverse process, spinous process in the middle, the facets are going to be located right here. So when you're doing your palpation, you can palpate the spinous process, move up a little and horizontal, and you're now at the facets. So the next thing that you need to know is how the facets are oriented to one another. It changes depending on what level of the spine you're at. So if you are in the cervical spine, the facets are oriented backwards, upwards and medial. This orientation tells you a little bit of how the motion at each joint will work. When you move down to the thoracic, the facets are oriented backwards, upwards and lateral. And when you move down to the lumbar spine, the facets are oriented backward and medial. So BUM, BUL and BM. Easy way to remember it, bumblebee. BUM BUL BM. Bumblebee M. On an exam they can ask you something as simple as, which way are the facets oriented in thoracic spine? The answer would be backwards, upwards, lateral. So how do I make the diagnosis using the facets? So if I'm palpating the facets in neutral, there's no extra movement. When I ask the patient to go into flexion, two things are going to happen. The facets will open and your thumbs will move cephalad. Cephalad just means toward the head, so they move upward. So if you draw this out, it's going to look something like this. The space between the facets will open and get larger, and your thumbs will move cephalad or towards the head. During extension, it's going to be backwards. When you're palpating during extension, the facets will close and your thumbs will move caudad. Caudad is a fancy way to say down or towards the feet. My teacher when I was in school, he had a really southern accent, and when he said caudad, it sounded like he was saying crawdad. So if you think of crawdad and the legs, caudad, legs, down. So if you're going to draw this out, during extension the joint space is going to get squished closed, and your thumbs will move downward. Squished closed, thumbs down, during extension. So how do you use these findings to tell you what the diagnosis is? So what you're going to do is palpate during neutral, during flexion and during extension, just like you did when you were using the transverse process. For the dysfunction, one of the facets may not open or close correctly, and that's going to tell you everything that you need to know. So if I'm going to draw this as a picture, let's say that we ask the patient to flex forward. On the right side, the facet opens normally and my thumb goes upward towards the head. But on the left side, my thumbs stay exactly the same. They stay where they were. This tells you that the left facet is dysfunctional and it's causing a left side bending in rotation. So if you pretend that my thumb and pinkie are the transverse processes, it is now going to the left. So side bend and rotated to the left. This is your findings during flexion. Now during extension, it's going to be a little backwards. So you ask the patient to extend back. On the left side, the joint space squishes closed and your thumb still goes down towards the feet like normal. But on the right side, nothing happens. Your thumb doesn't move properly. This tells you that the right side is dysfunctional. So the vertebral segments look the same during flexion and extension dysfunctions, but you have to understand that on the left side is a dysfunction for a flex and on the right side that's the dysfunctional facet for an extended. So let's do some practice questions over it. So let's say you're taking an exam and it tells you that during flexion, both thumbs move cephalad, and during extension, the right thumb goes down towards the feet but the left thumb stays immobile. So what's the dysfunction? The way that I like to do it is I draw this out. So during flexion, both thumbs move in the cephalad. So it will look something like this. Both facets open normally like they should. During extension, the right thumb moves downward towards the feet, and the left thumb stays immobile. So the right facet squishes closed like it should, but the left facet stays open. This is telling you that the left facet is dysfunctional during extension. So if you're using this to make the diagnosis, let's say that we're at T6, everything gets better during flexion. Remember, you always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So better in flexion means that it's a flex dysfunction. And if you look at our facet picture, you can tell that it is now rotated and side bent to the right because of the facet orientation. So you can put down that you are rotated right and side bent to the right. You can even use Fryette's laws to double check yourself if you need to. You know that since it's a flex dysfunction and using the second law, rotation and side bend occur in the same direction. So rotated right, side bent right. So for number two, let's say that in flexion, the right thumb moves upward like it normally should, but the left side stays immobile. And during extension, both thumbs move down normally. So what's the diagnosis? So we're going to do what we just did, we're going to draw it out. So during extension, we know that both thumbs move normally. So both facet spaces get squished closed and your thumbs move down normally. So now we're going to draw during flexion, so the right thumb moves upward as it normally should, but the left side stays closed, which is dysfunctional. Because of this dysfunctional facet, you can now see that the vertebral body is rotated and side bent to the left. It's really important to draw these out as you're going so you don't get tripped up by which facet is dysfunctional and which one isn't, and which thumb moves whatever way and which thumb goes where. If you draw it out, it makes it extremely easy so that you can get the points correct on the test. So draw it out every time. Use your hand model if you need to. This facet's dysfunctional, this one's normal, your thumb and pinkie move this way. So it's side bent and rotated to the left. So to write out the dysfunction, we're going to put T6, it gets better during extension, so it's an extended dysfunction. It's going to be rotated to the left and side bent to the left. So left thumb is immobile and your right thumb goes upward. So now the third example. So they can tell you which directions your thumb moves, but they can also tell you which facets open and close. So you need to be able to interpret that as well. So let's say that during flexion, both facets open normally. But during extension, the right facet closes but the left facet stays immobile. So we're going to stick with the theme of drawing it to make sure that we get the question correct. So during flexion, both facets open normally. When we look at extension, the right facet squishes closed but the left facet does not close normally. So the dysfunctional segment is on the left, but you're still rotated and side bent to the right. So very important just to draw this out every time. So for our diagnosis, we're going to say T6 again, everything is normally moving in flexion, so it's a flex dysfunction, and during our picture we saw that we are rotated and side bent to the right. So the FRS right. So right closes normally, the left is immobile, and both facets open during flexion. So in this lecture, we went over where exactly the facets are, how they move during flexion and extension, the orientation of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Just remember bumblebee M, and then three practice questions to go over how to make the correct diagnosis. And that's how you use the facet model to diagnosis the thoracic spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Tips for the COMATs]  
﻿At the end of each rotation, you're going to have to take a standardized exam. In the DO world these are called COMATs. The exam is going to go over everything that you were supposed to have learned over that rotation, but there's also going to be an OMM component. Of course, it's a good idea to just know everything, but each COMAT it may be a good idea to get really deep into specific osteopathic topics. So, to start off with we'll start with Pediatrics. Now in Pediatrics the cranial bones aren't exactly fused just yet, that occurs a little bit later in life. So, it may be a good idea to take another look at the cranial lecture, so that you understand all of the different cranial diagnosis and the motions of the cranial bones. This can really come into play when we start talking about the cranial nerves. If there's a cranial dysfunction, it's possible that that can lead to a cranial nerve impairment, which you may be able to see in one of your pediatric patients. So, without getting too deep and going over all of the cranial nerves again, here's a simple way to draw out some of the functions of the cranial nerves. So, if you can see it kind of looks like a face, so one -- cranial nerve one helps with smelling and this is located where the nose would be. Two, three, four and six around the eyes, five the whole face, seven the whole head, eight for hearing, 11 for your accessory nerve helping out the muscles of the neck and then you have three more. You have cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12. These are written in red because specifically for Pediatrics if there's some sort of an impairment of cranial nerve nine, 10 and or 12, you may see trouble feeding and latching in newborns. So, if you see a patient with feeding and latching issues as a newborn, they may be trying to get you to think about cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12 impairment. Now there is a specific combination between cranial nerves and possible cranial bones that are dysfunctional. There's a nice chart that we have in the notes that goes over everything, but in reality the cranial nerves overlap with a lot of different bones. Some of the bones that you need to be aware of is going to be the temporal bone, occipital and the sphenoid. It will be important for you to be able to match up a cranial nerve impairment dysfunction based off of the findings and then be able to figure out which cranial bone you may want to target your treatment towards, because there's such an overlap it's going to be really difficult for exam writers to figure out a good combination. So more than likely they're going to give you an impairment of a nerve with a combination of a bone to treat, but if you're ever super stuck and in doubt most cranial nerves can be treated by treating the temporal bone. So, if you're ever super stuck pick temporal. The next COMAT is going to be the psych COMAT. Now on the psych COMAT what sort of patient may you see? Someone with depression or anxiety. So, if a patient has depression, it's been shown that osteopathically they'll have a decreased cranial rhythm and they will have shallow and short breaths. So imagine this, a depressed patient can come in, cranial rhythmic impulse is going to be depressed. They may be hunched over, slouching, taking short rapid breaths. One thing that the exam writers may be trying to get you to think of is assessing for cranial function. So, if you see a depressed patient with a decreased CRI, make the connection that they're wanting you to assess cranial function. If you see the patient has difficulty breathing with shallow or short breaths, you should immediately think of respiration. So, make the connection here that a depressed patient with depressed breathing, they may have a respiratory dysfunction. Remember back to the ribs lecture where we talked about how to diagnose the ribs, dysfunctional sacrum, dysfunctional SCM. If you see that presentation make the connection and think of those topics specifically. The next COMAT is going to be surgery. Common patient that you're going to have on the surgery COMAT is a post-operative patient. There are three presentations that you would need to be aware of. Post-op atelectasis, wound healing and post-operative ileus. When you take the surgery COMAT, you're probably going to see a patient that has some of this. You need to be making some osteopathic thoughts about patients with these dysfunctions. So, if you see a presentation for post-op atelectasis, they're trying to get you to think about respiration again. You need to try and prevent post-op atelectasis. You can do that by improving their breathing, treat the ribs, treat the diaphragm, treat the SCM, potentially perform rib bracing. Go back to the ribs lecture if you want a more in-depth review. So once again respiration. Now wound healing. You need to be able to promote wound healing throughout the entire body for the patient. What you're going to have to do to promote wound healing is treat the lymphatic system. If you need a better refresher on lymphatics, go back to the lymphatics video. So, if you see wound healing think about treating the lymphatics. This means treat the choke points and perform some pumps, get the fluid moving again. Now post-operative ileus. They're trying to get you to think of the autonomic nervous system and patient facilitation. So, when you see the word atelectasis think of facilitation, think of excess sympathetic flow to the intestines. So post-op ileus, think of autonomic nervous system. Now the levels that you should pay particular attention to are T5 through T9 and T10 and T11. So, these two autonomic levels are where the majority of the organs in the abdomen are going to be located and where the majority of your general surgery questions will come from. If you need a better in-depth review of the autonomic nervous system, go back to the autonomic lesson. So, some Chapman's points that you'll definitely see on your surgery COMAT. You should be aware of the liver, the gallbladder, pancreas, the kidney and the appendix. You have Chapman's points on the anterior side and the posterior side. For the liver, these Chapman's points are located on the fifth and sixth rib interspaces on the right side of the body. On the posterior side, these are located on the fifth and sixth transverse processes on the right side. The gallbladder is located in the sixth interspace on the right side. On the posterior side, it's T6 on the right transverse process. For the pancreas, it's the seventh rib interspace on the right and on the posterior side, it's T7 transverse process on the right. For the kidney, this is the location that's one inch lateral and one inch superior to the umbilicus on the anterior side and on the posterior side it's on L1 transverse process bilaterally. Don't forget the appendix on the anterior side, it's on the tip of rib 12 on the right and on the posterior side it's on the lateral portion of rib 11 on the right. Now moving to the OB COMAT. Now on the OB COMAT it's safe to say that you're going to have some patients who are moms, who are pregnant, or maybe are new mothers, so moms. The patient presentation that you may see would be lower back pain and potentially some sort of autonomic facilitation. So autonomic nervous system facilitation. Now if you see this presentation, the exam writers might be trying to get you to think about the sacrum. So, the sacrum is going to move to compensate for pregnancy. When you're pregnant, the sacrum will bilaterally extend in order to compensate needed the extra room. Once that you've given birth, the sacrum will by laterally flex forward. So, when pregnant, bilaterally extended sacrum. After birth, the mom may have a bilaterally flexed sacrum. Now this motion of the sacrum is normal, but if it stays in these locations for an extended period of time, it can become dysfunctional and if it's dysfunctional that can lead to lower back pain and potentially some autonomic facilitation. If you need a refresher on the sacrum, take a look at the sacrum lesson. If you need a refresher on autonomics, take a look at the on anomic lesson. So, if you have a pregnant patient or a new mom who has lower back pain or autonomic facilitation, think of the sacrum. So, if you're thinking autonomics some important levels to remember are T10 through T11 for the gonads and T12 through L2 for the rest of the sex organs. Now to finish this up with some Chapman's points that you will probably see on the COMAT, you should know the Chapman's point for the uterus, the ovary, the vagina and the broad ligament. You should know the anterior Chapman's point and the posterior Chapman's point. For the uterus, the anterior Chapman's point is on the IT band and on the posterior side, it's the transverse process of L5 bilaterally. For the ovary, the anterior Chapman's point is on the pubic tubercle and on the posterior side it's the transverse process of T10 bilaterally. For the vagina the anterior side, it's on the IT band and the posterior side it's on the PSIS. For the broad ligament the anterior side is the IT band and posterior side is the PSIS. Now it may be possible that you would see a newborn on your OB exam. If you do just remember the cranial nerve findings. So, what about the internal exam and family and the OMM COMAT? For these COMATs, it's probably a good idea just to know everything. If you've made it this far into the lessons, you should have a pretty good understanding of osteopathy and the core concepts so that you can be prepared to answer any question that you see whether it's something that you've already studied or maybe something new that's going to require a little bit of understanding of core concepts for you to work out the correct answer. So, on the IE and family and OMM COMATs, it's a good idea to just know everything. Obviously, this isn't an all-inclusive list of what OMM things you may see on each COMAT, but this is a pretty good starting point for you. On Pediatrics, it's a good idea to take a look at the cranial nerves and cranial dysfunctions, noting that cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12 will affect feeding and latching. For the psych exam may be a good idea to look at cranial and respiration. For surgery, you want to avoid post-operative complications by looking at respirations, lymphatics and autonomic nervous system. For OB make sure that you take a look at that sacrum and for IE and family and OMM, you should probably just know everything and that's OMM for the specialties. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Tips for the PE]  
﻿The dreaded PE. I'm sure just talking about it is inducing stress in you right now. You have to see a certain number of patients in a short amount of time and oh yeah, as a DO student you need to bring in OMM and treat your patients using osteopathic techniques. As an OMM teaching fellow one of my roles was to take students who have previously failed the PE and help them pass on their next attempt. Now I'm going to give you my tips and tricks on how you can pass the PE and look forward to the OMM sections as easy points on test day. So, the first thing that you need to know is communication and there are two people that you need to communicate with on your exam day. The first one is the patient. Now if you have an osteopathic patient who's there to be seen for an osteopathic reason, they may try and tip you off by saying I heard your DO tell me about that, or maybe they'll say I had a friend who is treated with OMT. What is it? Can it help me? You need to be able to anticipate this question and come up with a quick elevator speech to give a quick demonstration of what osteopathy is and why you think it can be helpful for your patient. So, you need to think up an elevator speech. Now for a full elevator speech that I use you can take a look at the notes, but some quick tips that may help you out is saying that it's a hands-on treatment approach you can use it in the office today. It can help push your patient into a position where the body will heal itself. Things not to say is "Oh, it's like a chiropractor, but a little different" don't say that, you'll lose your points. Think up an elevator speech before PE day, so that when you get the question, you know what you're going to say. The next thing that you need to communicate is what you're doing and why? So, imagine this, you're going to the clinic with some sort of a complaint. The physician wants to give you a medication, but doesn't tell you what it is? Why he's going to give it to you? Or how he thinks it's going to help. It seems pretty crazy. It's the same thing with OMM. You need to be able to explain to your patient what you're doing and why you're doing it in terms that they can understand. So, you can't say you feel flex and side bend and rotated, they're not osteopathic physicians. They won't know what you're talking about, but you can say it feels like you can't move in this direction. I can perform a treatment that can help restore your range of motion. That would be better. So, think of something to say for what and why. The second person that you need to communicate with is the grader. Now the person grading the OMM portion of your PE is not going to be in the room with you. He's not going to be behind you palpating all of your palpatory findings. So, you need to be able to explain what you're feeling and why you are going to move on to whatever treatment plan based on that. The whole idea of the OMM portion of the PE is to see if you can take the palpatory findings and make a logical connection between that and what treatment technique you want to use and why you want to do it. So, you're helping yourself out if you say your findings out loud and then you go through your treatment out loud, so the grader can follow along logically. Now remember you can't say out loud flex, side bend and rotate, you can say their positional findings. So, it's in the patient terms, but just say it in a way that the grader can understand what you're saying. So, make sure that you say everything out loud. So, the next tip to keep in mind is variety. Now the OMM portion of the PE is to see if you have an understanding of osteopathic techniques. If you go in on PE day and for all of your osteopathic patients you perform counterstrain, you're not showing that you have a very wide knowledge of osteopathy in general. You're showing that you know how to perform counterstrain pretty well. That's not going to get you the points that you need on test day in order to pass. You need to show a variety. So maybe use a muscle energy technique, maybe use an indirect technique like FPR, use counterstrain, use myofascial, use a combination with all of your patients. Don't just stick to one treatment style but mix it up a little bit. So, some general tips is that each of your treatment should only take between three and five minutes. Don't kill all of your time with the patient trying to set up and perform as perfect treatment. Only stick to three to five minutes. You don't want to run out of time. One treatment that's easy to do is muscle energy. So, muscle energy is pretty easy. You put them into the barrier. You have them isometrically contract into the freedom. Do it three to five times, back to neutral, re-screen. So, this is a pretty easy autopilot that you can go onto to treat your patient osteopathically using muscle energy. You can also anticipate different treatments for different body parts that you may not have already learned. Just know put them in the barrier and to have them isometrically contract into the freedom. So, muscle energy is easy. Next is counterstrain. Now counterstrain is a good technique to use, but you need to plan ahead. Remember counterstrain takes a full 90 seconds. It's not like lab where you can say 1, 2, 89, 90. If you're in the PE and you perform counterstrain you need to make sure that you hold for the full 90 seconds. Now that 90 seconds can be detrimental if you're short on time, but it can also be very beneficial for you if you use it properly. During that 90 seconds you can explain your treatment plan, what you're doing, why you're doing it. You can communicate your entire thought process with the patient during that time. Don't sit there in silence, that's too awkward. Make sure that you use your time efficiently. So, if you do counterstrain, make sure to plan ahead for that full 90 seconds. Now one treatment technique that you don't want to use is HVLA. Now they say this rule everywhere when you're prepping for the PE. Don't use HVLA. It's a high-stress environment, so you may forget, but I'm telling you again. Don't use HVLA. The standardized patients are being seen by 12 students in the morning, maybe even 12 students in the afternoon. They're not going to feel very good at the end of the day if their back is being popped 24 times. Don't use HVLA, you're going to lose points and fail on that patient. So, no HVLA. Now your final treatment technique is myofascial. A myofascial is also pretty easy to use. It can be indirect, direct, active, passive really seems like you can just make up whatever you want to do for whatever muscle, but this technique is also incredibly easy for you to perform. So, in reality you should probably only use it once. Use Myofascial as your panic button. If you can't think of anything else and you freeze, go with myofascial one time. Don't use it on more than one patient, it's too easy and no matter what treatment technique you decide to do, every treatment ends exactly the same. You need to re-screen. You always need to re-screen your patient after every single treatment. You have to assess for efficacy and see if you actually did anything or not. If you did something your treatment was effective. If you didn't do anything, you might need to throw in another treatment. So, the next bit of advice is to anticipate. Now the PE rooms are set up in an ambulatory setting, so it's a good idea to anticipate some treatments that you may have to perform on your patients. Now here's where a little bit of truth comes into play. They're standardized patients. They may say that they have knee pain and they're there to be seen for an osteopathic treatment, but it's a standardized patient. They may or may not actually have somatic dysfunction findings for knee pain. So, it's really important in real life and in the PE that you screen every single patient, every single time. That way you can assess for any somatic dysfunction that you find and if you say your findings out loud, the greater can understand what you palpated and why you're deciding to treat that instead of whatever complaint that came in with. Remember the body is a big tensegrity unit. It's possible that back pain can cause knee pain. So just because they said knee, don't focus in on the knee. Make sure that you screen every patient, every time. So, screen your patients. Now going back to anticipation, what are some clinical things that you may see in an ambulatory setting. We'll draw out some examples. So, in the ambulatory setting there's a variety of reasons why a patient may come in with a complaint and you can potentially treat it osteopathically. So pretty good idea is to anticipate something that you may see. The patient comes in with a headache. You may be able to treat that using cranial. You can even perform a suboccipital release and if they complain of something like a cold or flu-like symptoms a facial sinus effleurage may be helpful. If they come in with an ear complaint, may be a good idea to perform the gall breath technique. If they come in with neck pain, you can start thinking about treating the cervical spine with muscle energy or any other treatment modality that you would like to use, or you can target your treatment at the SCM or the TRAPS. If a patient comes in with shoulder pain after they've been playing sports or maybe they were in a motor vehicle collision, take a look at the scapula and assess for a somatic dysfunction. Maybe even perform the Spencer technique in the shoulder, or maybe perform some counterstrain for the SITS muscles. If a patient comes in with back pain, there are plenty of different treatments that you can use for back pain, but this may be a good time for you to show your osteopathic variety and use something different than muscle energy. Maybe try an indirect technique like Still or FPR. So, let's do FPR for the T-spine. Maybe the patient has been coughing, because they've had a cold for the past couple weeks and now their chest hurts on the outside, maybe think of a rib dysfunction. So maybe you should screen the ribs and assess for a somatic dysfunction there. Let's say they were skateboarding, and they fell forward now their elbow hurts, maybe take a look at their radial head and treat that with muscle energy. Now remember the body is a big tensegrity unit. Pain in one place can cause pain or somatic dysfunction in another. If a patient presents with wrist pain, it would still be logical to check out the radial head. So, if you see a patient who might be complaining of wrist pain, maybe take a look at the radial head too, or maybe you could perform a carpal tunnel release. Maybe the patient has some hip pain after a long road trip, or maybe they fell going down the stairs. If they have some hip and pelvic pain, maybe take a look at the sacrum with the seated flexion test or maybe even the innominates with the standing flexion test. Take a look at the piriformis or psoas and you already know plenty of techniques to treat all of these locations, because you've already been through the video lessons up until this point. Maybe the patient comes in with knee pain after they fell or maybe they were playing soccer. One good place to look is maybe the fibular head. You can maybe even perform some counterstrain on the knee ligaments and once again the body is a big tensegrity unit. If they come in with ankle pain, it would be logical for you to still assess the fibular head. If it's not the fibular head you can potentially do some more counterstrain on some of the ligaments of the ankle. So, we went over a lot in these PE tips. Hopefully this will help decrease your stress and make you look forward to the OMM section on your PE. Just remember that you need to communicate with the patient and the grader. You need to show variety in your osteopathic treatments. Make sure that you only use myofascial one time as your panic button. Anticipate by screening every single patient and going in there with some treatment ideas in your back pocket just in case and that's OMM tips for the PE. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Treatment Modalities]  
﻿We're going to do something pretty ambitious in this lecture. We're going to go over all of the high yield treatment styles that you're going to see in the clinic and while you're reading your textbooks. The purpose of this lecture is to give you an idea of all of the treatment styles and what makes them similar or different to one another. This lecture is also going to help you choose which treatment style you want to use for which sort of patient. This lecture is going to be a little bit longer, but it's set up like this on purpose so that we can go over everything all at once. During this lecture, the high yield points that you should pay particular attention to are which treatments are direct, indirect, active and passive. So to start off with, we're going to go over some quick vocabulary. So you can have an active treatment, means that the patient assists in the treatment. Meaning that at some point during an active treatment, you are going to ask the patient to do some sort of motion. A passive treatment is going to be the opposite. During a passive treatment, we're going to ask the patient just to remain completely still. At no point during the treatment do we ask the patient to do anything. There are two different types of treatment, and the first one is direct. The direct treatment is a treatment that directly engages the restrictive barrier. So remember, from the previous videos we were talking about how you always name a diagnosis based off what it can do. So the name of the diagnosis is the freedom. So the barrier is what they cannot do, so it's going to be the restriction. It's going to be the opposite of the freedom. So if the diagnosis is something like T6 flexed, rotated and side bending to the right, the barrier is going to be extended, rotating and side bending to the left. It's going to be the opposite. And indirect treatment is going to be the opposite. Instead of the engaging the barrier like we did for a direct treatment, we're going to engage the freedom, or what the patient can do. So why would you choose a direct treatment or an indirect treatment? It's going to depend on what sort of patient you see and what sort of dysfunction that they have. So the typical patient that you will choose a direct treatment for would be someone who's younger, who does not have too much pain during motion, and maybe even a dysfunction that's chronic. When you're doing a direct treatment, you're going to be engaging the barrier, or what they can't do. Sometimes this is a little bit painful or uncomfortable for the patient. If it's painful, then you're going to do something that's indirect. But if it's not painful, you can stick to direct. So indirect is going to be the opposite. You're going to do this for someone that may be older, who has pain with the dysfunction, and maybe something that's a little bit more acute. So if you think of an acute dysfunction, when it first happens it may be a little bit more painful than after you've been sitting on it for a while. So acute and painful, think indirect. Chronic, no pain, think of a direct treatment. So for the rest of this, we're going to go with one example, and I'm going to relate all of the treatments back to it so that you understand the barrier, the restriction, the freedom, all the vocabulary. So let's say that the dysfunction is going to be T7 FRS Right. So you always name it by what it can do. So T7 can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. This is the freedom. The opposite is what they cannot do, the restrictive barrier. So as I'm going through these examples, keep in mind direct, indirect, active, passive, barrier, freedom. So the first treatment style is going to be muscle energy. When I say muscle energy, what I want you to think of is isometric contraction. I want you to think of lengthening the muscle to engage the restrictive barrier and then an isometric contraction into the freedom that will then shorten the muscle. It'll make sense as I write this out. So there are two flavors of muscle energy. The first one is post-isometric relaxation. This is going to be a direct technique and also active. So this means that we are going to engage the barrier during treatment and we're going to ask the patient to move during the treatment and help us with the treatment. When you hear muscle energy, I want you to think of the golgi tendon organ. Without getting deep into the golgi tendon organ, it basically boils down to this. The golgi tendon organ recognizes that there is extra tension during treatment. It's going to tell the agonist muscle to relax, which is then going to allow the physician to move further into the barrier. So if you hear muscle energy, think golgi tendon organ. So how do I set up and perform this treatment? The first step is you are going to passively move the patient into the barrier. So the first step of the treatment is going to have the patient seated an relaxed so he is passive. You need to move him into the barrier. The barrier is what they cannot do. So if they can flex, rotate right, side bend right, they cannot extend, rotate left, side bend left. So the barrier is what they cannot do. The diagnosis is what they can do. Make sure you keep that straight. Once they are into the barrier, this is where you're going to ask the patient to assist during the treatment. You're going to have the patient actively isometrically contract to the freedom. So you have the patient engaged in the barrier already. You're going to ask the patient to move into the freedom. So move into the diagnosis, move into what they can do, which is flex, rotation right, side bend right. Remember from the previous lectures, we talked about what an isometric force is. So they're going to try and move in towards the freedom, but during treatment, you are going to hold them still and give them enough of a muscle force that keeps them in their position. So that's isometric. The patient pushes while the physician pushes, both forces cancel each other out and there's no motion. Once they actively move into the freedom for three to five seconds, you are then going to passively reengage the new barrier. So this is going to be the same barrier as before, but it's the new barrier since you can now go further into the barrier because of the golgi tendon organ telling the agonist muscle to relax. So new barrier, what they can't do, extended, rotate left, side bend left. The next step is going to repeat everything three to five times. Once you have performed the entire treatment three to five times, you can then bring the patient passively back to neutral and rescreen. At the end of every single treatment, whether it's muscle energy or anything else that we discuss, you have to rescreen and make sure that your treatment worked. So rescreen at the end of everything. So I said muscle energy comes in two flavors. You have post-isometric and reciprocal inhibition. This treatment style is going to be direct or indirect, but it will always be active. So direct or indirect, either engages the barrier or engages the freedom. You'll see the difference during setup. So if it's a direct treatment, you want to put the patient into the barrier during setup. So what's an example of this? The easiest way to think of reciprocal inhibition is going to be your biceps and your triceps. Your biceps will be the agonist muscle and the dysfunctional muscle, and your triceps will be the antagonist. So imagine that the patient has hypertonic biceps, meaning that they can go into flexion but they cannot go into extension. So if I'm going to directly engage the barrier, I'm going to ask the patient to do what they cannot do, which is go into the extension barrier. And then I'm going to have the patient contract their antagonist muscle, their triceps. If I want this to be an indirect treatment, I'm going to place the patient into what they can do, which is flexion, and then I'm going to ask them to engage their antagonist muscle, which is their triceps. So in reciprocal inhibition, you're always wanting to engage the antagonist muscle. In post isometric relaxation, your goal is to engage the agonist muscle. So for our example of the hypertonic bicep, if we want to directly engage the barrier, we're going to extend the bicep and flex the tricep. If I want this to be an indirect treatment, I'm going to place the patient into what they can do, which is a flexed bicep, and I'm still going to ask them to flex the tricep. Once you've done the treatment, you then put the patient back in a neutral and rescreen. So the next treatment style is going to be high velocity, low amplitude, or HVLA. Whenever we think about HVLA, think of the technique that causes the pops. So when we're talking about HVLA, think of popping and cracking. So HVLA. This type of treatment is going to be direct and passive. So during the treatment setup, we're going to engage the barrier and it's passive, we're not going to ask the patient to do anything. So the first step in this treatment is going to be passive motion into the barrier. So relating this back to our example, the patient's diagnosis is T7 flexed, rotated right, side bent right. This is what they can do. This is the freedom. So if we want to engage the barrier, we engage the opposite. So we'll want to engage extension, rotation left, side bending left. So the first step, passive to the barrier. The next step is to instruct the patient to relax, which mostly includes breathing techniques for them to relax. When you're trying to thrust through the barrier, it's a little bit easier when the patient is relaxed and their muscles aren't tense. Once you have the patient relaxed, then you are going to perform your HVLA thrust through the barrier. So we already have the patient in the barrier, which is extension, rotating left, side bending left. So the HVLA thrust goes through the barrier. So your thrust will further push them into extension, rotation left, side bending left. This thrust is what's going to cause your pop. After the treatment, bring them back to neutral and rescreen. So the next treatment style is facilitated positional release, or FPR. This treatment style is going to be a little bit different than muscle energy and HVLA. It's going to be indirect and passive. So this treatment is indirect. What we've previously been talking about is direct. So instead of engaging the barrier like we did for muscle energy and HVLA, we're going to set the patient up into the freedom first. So the first step is going to be passively moving the patient into the freedom. So for our example, T7 can flex, can rotate to the right, can side bend to the right. So we're going to passively move them into what they can do. So flexed, rotated right, side bent right. They're now into the freedom. The next step is going to add an activating force. So what's an activating force? When you're performing your treatment, you just add compression down to the segment of dysfunction. So that can be from the head and neck or that can be from the shoulders for any of the dysfunctions lower down in the spine. So you add the compression force next. In this example, T7 is dysfunctional, so you need to make sure that your compression force goes down to T7 for the treatment. Once you add the activating force, you are then going to passively move the patient further into the freedom. So you're going to put the patient into the freedom, what they can do. You add the activating force. With the activating force, you push them further into the freedom. So add the activating force, push them further into flexion, rotation to the right and side bending to the right. Once you do that, the treatment's been complete, so now you can passively return them back to neutral and then rescreen. So you release your force, return to neutral, and always rescreen. The next treatment style is going to be balanced ligamentous tension, or BLT. This treatment's going to be similar to FPR in that it's an indirect technique. So this treatment is indirect and passive. So like FPR where it's indirect, but not like muscle energy or HVLA that's direct. So for BLT, indirect, engage the freedom. The next step that you're going to do is engage the freedom in three planes of motion. So think about three planes of the motion of the diagnosis. You have flexion extension, rotation, and side bending. We're going to engage the freedom where it makes the tissues all neutral during your first step of the treatment. So indirect, what they can do, first step is passive on three planes. Once they're in the freedom for the three planes of motion, the next thing you do is just hold and wait for the release. Once they feel the release or the softening of the tissues, you then bring them back to neutral and rescreen. So again, with our treatment example, T7 is flexed, rotated right, side bent right. The three planes of motion that you're going to engage, flexion, rotation right, side bending right, into the freedom. Hold it there until you feel a release. Once that you do, neutral and rescreen. The next treatment is going to be still technique. Now still is going to be a little bit different. It's both direct and indirect, as well as being a passive treatment. So during this treatment, you're going to engage both the direct barrier or what they cannot do, and the indirect barrier or the freedom, what they can do, what the diagnosis is. So the first step of the treatment is going to be to passively move the patient into the freedom. So for our example, T7, they can flex, rotate right, side bend right. Put them into the freedom, so put them into flex, rotate right, side bent right. The next step is going to be to add an activating force. Once you have the activating force applied, this is where the direct portion of the treatment will begin. You add the activating force and then you move the patient into the direct barrier. So in this treatment so far, you have the patient what they can do, flex, rotate right, side bend right. You add the activating force and then you move the patient further into the barrier or what they cannot do, which will be extension, rotation left, side bending left. So now passive through barrier. Once there, you can then release your activating force, bring the patient back to neutral, and then you rescreen. Always rescreen. So up until now, all of the treatment styles we've talked about, I want you to think of using when you're treating something in the spine or some sort of a joint. The next three treatment styles we're going to go over, I want you to think about treatment a muscular dysfunction instead of treating a spinal dysfunction. So think muscle for the next three. This next one is going to be counter-strain. So counter-strain is an indirect treatment that is also passive. Now we have a whole video devoted strictly to counter-strain that comes on later in the series. But for right now, I want you to think of indirect treatment that's also passive. So if you're doing an indirect treatment, you put the dysfunction where it can go. If it's a hypertonic muscle, what it can do is bring the two ends of the muscle closer together. So for a counter-strain treatment, you're whole goal is to bring two ends of the muscle closer together. We're going to do this by folding and holding, or just shortening the muscle however we can. So when you think of counter-strain, think of fold and hold, which will shorten the muscle. The next treatment style is just going to be stretching. Now imagine stretch as just being the opposite of counter-strain. It's going to be a direct treatment. The whole goal is to elongate the muscle. So you're going to take the attachment and the origin and take them further apart by stretching the muscle. This can be accomplished by doing the opposite of whatever the muscle usually does. For example, if the bicep normally flexes, if I'm trying to stretch it I'm going to do the opposite. I'm going to extend it. So stretch is direct and passive. Your whole goal is to elongate the muscle. In this last treatment, it's really just about anything that you want it to be. It's myofascial. This can be direct or indirect, it can be active or passive. It all depends on how you set up the patient for treatment and if you're going to ask the patient to assist you or not. So myofascial. This can be direct or indirect and can be passive or active. In this treatment, you're going to move the muscles around in three planes of motion, including traction, rotation and compression. For a more indepth example, look later on in the series at the lumbar lecture. So how are we going to make this direct or indirect? It's easy. You either engage the barrier or you engage the freedom. So three planes of motion, which include traction, rotation and compression. Direct to the barrier or where the tissues cannot go, and indirect into the freedom. So when you're performing this technique and you're putting the patient directly into the barrier, you're going to put the tissue where it doesn't want to go. When you're pushing in that direction, you're going to have a hard end feel. It's going to feel very taut when you move that way. Indirect, you engage the freedom, when you move the tissues in that direction, it softens or loosens. So how do you make this treatment active or passive? This is where you use enhancers. So what's an enhancer? An enhancer is during your myofascial treatment, you ask the patient to contract whatever muscle you're treating. So for example, let's say you're doing myofascial to the diaphragm. You're doming it and pushing your fingers into the diaphragm. If you want them to contract, you can have them actively help you in treatment by deep inhaling and deep exhaling. This movement is going to make the treatment active and it's an enhancer. So enhancers make the treatment active. So these are all of the treatment styles that we're going to go over. You have muscle energy, where you think of post-isometric relaxation and reciprocal inhibition. Always think of isometric contraction. HVLA, think of the popping. FPR, where it's all indirect. BLT where you have the three planes of motion. Still technique where it's both direct and indirect. Move on to the muscular treatments, you have counter-strain which is fold and hold, stretching which is elongating the muscle, and myofascial which is really the grab bag of everything. So the important part of this is that you understand the concepts of direct, indirect, active and passive. So we're going to make a big chart with everything. So we have muscle energy, HVLA, FPR, BLT, still, counter-strain, stretch and myofascial. And each treatment can either be direct, indirect, passive or active. So what about muscle energy? Direct, indirect, active or passive? When you think muscle energy, think of it being direct, but also know that occasionally it can be indirect. This is an active treatment because the patient is actively helping you. He's doing some sort of muscle contraction. When you think of HVLA, it's direct, you're directly engaging the barrier, the treatment is passive because the patient relaxes, the patient doesn't do anything. FPR is indirect where you engage the freedom, and it's passive because the patient does not help you during treatment. BLT is the same, where it's all indirect and it's a passive treatment. Still is the weird one where it's both direct and indirect. Although when you're thinking of still technique in the clinic or on an exam or wherever else, think of still as being an indirect technique. But just know that it's both. So if you get asked to do an indirect technique and still is an option, think of indirect still technique. This technique is also passive, he doesn't help. Counter-strain is going to be indirect, where you engage the freedom and you shorten the muscle, and it's going to be passive where the patient does not help you. The stretch, you're elongating the muscle and doing what it cannot do. That's going to be direct and it's going to be passive, because the patient is not going to help. The myofascial, everything, depending on however you set it up. So it's direct, indirect, passive, or if you want to use enhancers, active. One final quick thought is treatment sequencing. When you're treating something, you always want to think of sequencing by starting centrally and working your way out peripherally. So just as an example, if I want to treat something in the hand and I'm thinking of sequencing, start in the thoracic area, then move out to the shoulder, then upper extremity, then your hand distal dysfunction. You want to do this in order to make sure that you hit all of the compensatory patterns along the way. So if you get asked about sequencing, think central, work out peripheral. So to sum up everything in this massive lecture, we talked about all the high yield treatment styles. We discussed active, passive, direct and indirect, which are your main things that you have to know about each treatment. Why you would use direct or indirect. We went through examples with all of them, and then we also did a chart that has everything that's super high yield. And that's OMM treatment techniques. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Beating Clinical Vignettes]  
﻿The reason why I enjoy teaching clinical medicine so much is that it does prepare you for both life and the test but the NBME shelves and the USMLE step two licensing exams common the form of Clinical Vignettes. Now, I actually think they've done a pretty good job of taking an automated test to a testing center that tests both knowledge and reasoning as best as a multiple choice question can. Specifically though, how you score on a multiple choice exam does not determine your value as a physician and it does not assess your clinical reasoning or your ability to practice medicine but those scores do matter in getting into residency. So as you begin to prepare for these exams, it'd be useful if you prepared for the exams and yes, that's learning the knowledge but also, learning how to beat the test by using good test taking strategy. I don't say this to brag but I took my internal medicine boards, a nine-hour exam in three and half hours and people ask me how do I prepare for a medicine board exam and I said I made OnlineMedEd, you probably shouldn't copy that pattern, it's pretty hard but at the same time having learned how to write questions in residency and practice writing them, I was able to take those tests much faster and much more efficiently and still get the answer right. I'll show you how. First, we want to learn how the test writer writes the question? How to write a question? The first thing a test writer does is determines what the educational objective it's going to be. It may be something as vague as how do you diagnose a CHF exacerbation? Or what medications do you use to treat coronary artery disease? Or it could be something very specific like in [indiscernible] how do you anticoagulate a fib and who do you anticoagulate in? But they choose an educational objective and that is going to be the question they ask. Then they choose a right answer and that's usually going to be in the way of what is the best next step in the management, how do you treat, how do you diagnose, what is the diagnosis or something as simple as polypharmacy is bad, how do you avoid doing unnecessary things in the elderly? There's going to be one right answer and notice the vignette hasn't even been considered yet but this is what they do, educational objective first, then the right answer. Then they're going to write the wrong answers. The wrong answers are called distractors, a good distractor is one that it sounds attractive to someone who only has lose word association. That is if you only study buzzwords, you're going to get pulled into a trap. Wheezing asthma? They're going to give you a wheeze, but it won't be asthma, because they know that word association exists and they'll purposefully change of in yet to make it non-asthma even though there's wheezing or distractor is the right thing to do for a disease, just not at that time. Esophageal varices should be given propranolol or nadolol as an outpatient, turning an acute hemorrhage, they should not be given. Esophageal varices one vignette makes nadolol the right answer, one makes it absolutely the wrong answer. So a distractor is one that sound attractive or could be right if the vignette was adjusted a little bit and then they build the vignette and in that vignette what they're going to do is include the positives that are required for the right answer. The elements of the illness script for the right answer will be present and then they're going to spend a little bit of time making sure that those that the detractors, the wrong answers are listed as negative and this is very important. Even in the electronic exams they don't have 10 minutes per question. So they cannot write you a full history in physical. It's only couple of lines. So in those couple of lines, they need to make it clear that one answer is right and all the other answers are wrong and the idea will be that you will get the things you need in that vignette at the USMLE step one and two level, there are no curve balls. What they give you is what they need. So you start stacking up the things that go along with the right answer and you start crossing off the wrong answers because the things you should be looking for aren't there. This is also the danger of getting other Qbanks. We do not mold our questions that is to say as we'll talk about in a minute how do you learn from these questions. We test one educational objective one way and then we explain in the answers why the other ones are wrong for that one vignette and what you can do to change the vignette to make that distractor correct. In that way we make five questions out of one but we only give you one question a lot of Qbanks in order to pad their numbers ask the same question again, only tweak two things and make a different answer right and it's a new question, we don't do that but recognize it's also based on a hinge. Most of the time, you have to know the diagnosis from the vignette MI? Before you can ask the hinge what medication impairs mortality, beta blocker? What's the most common cause of death in 24 hours? What's the pathology look like after a week? What's Dressler's syndrome. They can ask all of these questions based on the same vignette which says, this person is having an MI. Okay. So this is how they write the questions. How should you actually take the exam? The first thing you're going to do and I say this with great emphasis because even my own residence don't do this, we have the question of the day, even after me poking and prawning and making them do it, they still do it out of order. The first thing you should do is read the question? Read the question first, that is always going to be the last line of the vignette. Read the question, the hinge first, then read the options, the answer choices next. What's you're doing is priming your brain. You want to at least know what universe you're in and usually it's going to be along the same question of what is the best next step in management and if what you see as answer choices are iron, IV estrogen, uterine artery ligation transfusion, you know it has something to do with uterine bleeding. Whereas if you saw aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, low molecular weight heparin therapeutic dose, you're probably in the coronary artery disease section and so first, you should be able to identify that this is OB, this is cardiology but then if you can identify the educational objective and then only once you've read the answer choices and the question do you then go back and read the vignette. To prove a point, I know this has happened to everyone, think about that time you read the vignette and you are so excited because you knew what the diagnosis was, you're highlighting all the things that were right for that diagnosis, you're like, okay, this is a stroke, I got it and then it asks you what seizure medicine should you give? And you're like, huh? I thought this question is about stroke? Well, you wasted that entire time which you had go back, undo all you're highlighting and read the vignette again, because, oh, my God it's not at all what I thought or that time you're completely lost in that vignette and you have no idea what's going on and then only after you read the question and the answer choices because you start narrowing them down. Often, you can narrow it down to one or two just by reading the question and the answer choices and then as you go through the vignette having already primed your brain with the universe and educational objective, you're looking for those pertinent positives and pertinent negatives. In the case, in order to help you forget what the right answer is, that's how you can accelerate and not get trapped when five things fit and one thing is off, because you're looking for multiple things in and if the vignette gives you five things that points you to one direction, that's where they're going for. The last question is going to be how do you learn or how do you use a Qbank. There are two ways to use a Qbank. The first one is to learn. The second one is to practice. Questions must be done to do well On STEP. You have to practice doing questions in order to do the questions. Very much like a boxer has to train in the gym sparring in order to actually prepare for the fight. If he does a bunch of skipping rope, he's going to have great cardio but he won't have any technique. So you have to do the thing that happens on game day. You must practice. But to use questions, a Qbank to learn involves this. You should do the Qbank untimed and with tutor mode on, so that every question you do, you follow the same path, read the question, read the answers then read the vignette, select an answer and read the entirety of the explanation. Don't feel satisfied ha, I guessed right this time. What you want to be able to do is say, I know why the right answer is right, I also know how to change the vignette to make the other answers wrong and a lot of Qbanks, even very advanced ones, just tell you why the answer is wrong but they don't tell you it's a good distractor. They just tell you why it was stupid and you never pick it. Instead a good well-written question is going to have four distractors which are all legit and the explanations to tell you why those distractors are wrong this time and what you could do to make them right. If you're going to use a Qbank for practice it should be timed, tutor mode off and you read only the answer explanations of the ones you've got wrong. The idea as we'll discuss in the next lesson is that when you're learning, you want to engage all the material. When you're practicing, what you want to do is feel what it's like to take 44 questions in a row. To do it seven times in a row and when you get fidgety, when do you start freaking out? When do you need to take a break? How long a break do you need to take? How well can you attend two blocks in a row? Is that a good idea? You're not trying to get any more knowledge force in here, you're just simulating what it's like to take the test, where in learning you want to go slow and make sure you engage all the explanations to maximize that learning. Okay. So we spent a lot of time on how to write the question and if you know how people write the question it makes sense then on how to take it. Read the question and the answer choices looking for the educational objective, you can generally narrow it down to two or three answers, then you read the vignette looking for the things that you expect in the illness script, the things that we taught you in the videos and in the notes that are then going to increase or decrease the likelihood that that one is the right answer and you pick the one that has the most pluses and to use a Qbank, decide whether you're going to learn, go slow, be thorough or practice, get through them, feel what it's like to take the test. That is Education Questions. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Intro to Education]  
﻿At OnlineMedEd we have created an adult learning paradigm that maximizes effectiveness and efficiency. It's based on adult educational theory, research in the field who haven't made this thing haphazardly and if you follow the script we give you, follow the schedule, do exactly what we say, you're going to do well but not everyone is going to commit like that. So, what I want to do in the next series of lessons is show you what's out there, that is give you the concepts, the maps behind why you'd pick one thing over another. I believe that most medical students as they enter medical school know how they want to study, in groups, in pairs, on their own, questions, reading, lessons, videos, lectures, whatever you're learning style. The problem is you've made those conclusions in an environment that was based on the wrong thing, 45 minute long PowerPoint lectures given in a dark room in one hour slots where you had to start when the lecture was ready. Which means you probably played Clash of Clans, checked your email and went on to ESPN.com rather than paying attention or you just didn't go at all because that's not how you study. As I say, most medical students succeed in spite of their medical school not because of and so what I want to do is explore the things that are going to get you to succeed and this is useful because success at this point in your life is not about getting a score, step two scores matter, they do but at this point, it's about learning the foundations for the rest of your life. So, test success and life success are obtained the same way. So, this introduction just gives the outline of what the next series is going to look like, we're going to talk about study materials that is resources. What's out there, what are the different types of resources or study materials and how do you best utilize them. Of course, since the USMLE step two is all about multiple choice questions and vignettes. We are going to talk about clinical vignettes, how they're written and once you understand how they're written, you can understand how to take the test better and also how to benefit from doing questions, more in that in that lecture. We're also going to talk about the phases of learning and this is more about STEP prep than it is life prep, the idea being that you need to have rigorous study periods and then also training for test day where that rigorous training is going to be what you're going to do for the rest of your life as you learn the medicine in your chosen field but then also understand that there is a right away to prepare for test day and if you know what you're doing, you can plan accordingly and lastly, to sort of set some schedules, that is what is your actual goal and how much are you willing to commit to studying, how much time do you have and then you can build the right schedule for the right goal. Both of these are more a STEP prep than they are life and then OnlineMedEd is not based haphazardly on something we made up, right, it's based on adult education theory and so, for those of you who want to know why we do what we do in the way we do it and why it's so effective and so efficient, this won't help you practically but at least you'll know some insight behind what we do, there's the final fifth video called educational theory. So in the next couple of lectures I'm going to show you our paradigm and why we do what we do. Even if you don't want to use our paradigm, you want to do whatever you want, I want you walking away with a good concept of what's the right way to use resources, what are my realistic goals and how hard am I going to have to work and based on those goals what should I actually do rather than rely on whatever recommendation came from the class before and what do you got and he was one class above you and he thinks they did pretty well. That is Introduction to Education. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Making Sense of Educational Resources]  
﻿You can find the written version of this on your dashboard in the resources tab on the shelf and STEP prep study guide. What I want to talk about here are the different resources that are out there and I don't mean like name the brands, I mean identify and quantify what resources are available and how you should use them. Everyone is going to learn differently, everyone's going to prefer one over another but I want you walking away from this lesson knowing what your options are and how best to use them and we'll finish off with our learning paradigm and why we've chosen to do that. Well first, since learning usually occurs self-directed in medical school, is books but it's important you understand the different types of books that are out there and there are three kinds. There's the review book, the reading book and the reference book. The idea here is that as you go down the list you go up on the detail. First and foremost, never use a reference book to study. The only time you should touch a reference book is when you are asked to give a detailed talk to your team and only the specialist on the team is going to understand when you speak and everyone is going to be completely bored by you. Reference books are those ones that are online, but also things like Harrison's for medicine and Williams for gynecology. The tones that are so enormous they're not even worth reading and some people will tell you, you should read those reference books. No, you should not. You will not have the time to get through them and even if you do you're not going to remember anything from them. Reference books are about truth, not understanding. Everything we do here is about understanding and retention. Reference books, good for truth, truth you don't need as a medical student. You need black and white, yes-no, classic illness scripts. Not all the details about everything all the time. So the two were going to engage are the review books and the reading books, and the review books are going to be there primarily for memory that is repetition and retention. You've seen these review books, you've probably used one for step one. That's going to be things like first aid step up. The review book traditionally is just the bulleted lists tables, if you read the review book without ever having gauged the content, you wouldn't know what anything meant and some people like to use it as a way to prime, I don't recommend that. Instead, what I recommend is that you learn the material well and then you engage that review book to trigger memory cues and on OnlineMedEd, this is called quick tables. The reading book is the thing that takes a narrative form; complete sentences paragraphs, pictures, diagrams, but it's not so much that you can't get through it, ACP essentials is a great example of this, if you start talking about Harrison's and Williams' and Schwartz, no go. At OnlineMedEd these reading materials are the notes and the notes are in eight and a half by eleven, one-page or two-page per lesson. Small amount of reading to do but the idea is you read the material to get acquainted with it before you then go on to learn it. We all know about lecturers. Right? And this is sort of why OnlineMedEd was created in the first place because we've all been through those in-person lectures. Now, you know that person who lectures phenomenally and you get so excited, when like that person is going to give a lecture the whole class shows up and they lecture for an hour but you've been there, an hour-long PowerPoint talks in a dark room where you either fall asleep because the guy is going on and on and on about some detail you don't care about or you check your email or ESPN, so we're getting rid of that. Now, of course being in person if you're very good at it is that there's a value added but most of the time in-person lectures are going to be really the person who has memorized their PowerPoint and drones on and on. So instead, we put our lectures online and the online lectures, that is the videos which are free allow you, the learner, to start, stop, repeat, speed up or whatever, you're in total control as opposed to starting when the lecturer is ready, you start when you're ready and being audiovisual it gives you another ahead at the stuff you had just read in the notes. Being in medical school, I know you know this already but to succeed you must do questions but it is important that you do not just do questions, you must do a USMLE style vignettes. What that means is not there's a very long paragraph that's obnoxious and describe something, what I mean is that it has to be a second order question. What is the best next step? What is the diagnosis? That is, you must first make the diagnosis from the vignette then they ask you a question, a detail about the thing you've just identified. You have to first make the diagnosis of myocardial infarction before you know to give a beta blocker as opposed to the questions that I've asked, what's the side effect of a beta blocker? That may still be asked but in a very different way. This of course is our Q bank. Now, to talk about it a little bit in a moment how we intend you to need to use the Qbank. Lots of people use Qbanks just to study from and of course we have the next lesson which is how to do questions and then there are flash cards and flash cards you have to be very careful about. Flash cards is available in the Flashback app as well on the dashboard in the flash cards. Flash cards are useful if they're used as a memory tool like the review book. Test writers want you to have free word association. Wheezing-asthma and they're going to give you a question about wheezing and asthma is going to be a choice but it has nothing to do with asthma. If you just loosely learn and rather than getting the entire illness script that is the patient presentation, diagnosis and treatment and you don't know a little bit about it, all you know is some loose word association that are going to trap you with distracters as we'll talk about in the questions section. So flash cards are useful, but only when used in conjunction with other resources that help solidify the information you're learning rather than try to teach it to you from the start and there's some other things I didn't put up here that is like journal articles, primary literature, academics hate that I say this and I am an academic myself but I really don't think that you should be reading reference books or primary literature, it's not worth it. You have to first learn that the person who has a crushing substernal chest pain has an MI and that everyone with coronary artery disease needs beta blockers [indiscernible] before you start reading about primary literature in the most up and coming stuff. Right? In medical school you must learn the classic illness script, black-white, yes-no. So these are the different options you have and you've probably figured this out from your own university or your own searching on forums, you must have a review book and you must have questions. It doesn't matter which book you pick as long as you have one of the main review sources and the Qbank that is learn the material you absolutely must identify on the test and practice for the test, okay. At OnlineMedEd we've created our learning paradigm called PACE. Which stands for prime, acquire, challenge and enforce and we go into more detail on this on that last lecture in educational theory. The idea is that you do P, A, and C at once and then you use E when it's right. Let's talk about it in just a second. For prime, what we want you to do is read the notes and then in that scene session after you finish reading the notes, taking down your own notes in the quick tables, you then watch the video. You just read the same material and now you get it again audiovisual and of course we keep our lessons short because that's how adult learners learn. But then we want you to take that information you just learned and force you into a new uncomfortable situation where you actually have to use it. That is the challenge portion where you use the Qbank. Now, you don't have to follow PACE rigidly. If you do, you'll have success but not everyone's going to want to do all the pieces and sometimes you'll want to save the questions for later on when you're preparing for the test not necessarily at the same time. You can use these resources however you want but our learning paradigm is set up to maximize understanding and retention. We do that by delivering it in multiple modalities, repeating that same information in different ways challenging you a little bit and then when it's the right time to use the quick tables and the Flashback app to cue up key things in memory. Forty-eight hours after you watch a video your flash cards become active because at 48 hours is what the maximum time to reengage that memory to solidify it and you get extra repeats of the must-know information to the quick tables, alright. These are the resources you have to choose from. Do you have to use all of them? No. Do you have to use any one? Probably not, but I would definitely get that review book and the Qbank but then as we're going to talk about you may have to set your own goals, how long you have and what do you want to score and what's your baseline but when you choose a study schedule or when you choose a study system, I want you to know what you're picking and why knowing the limitations of each of the different things that are available and most importantly stay away from primary literature and reference books. They're too much to study for where you're at. That is Education Resources. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Our Educational Theory]  
﻿This final lesson on Educational Theory will probably serve no practical purpose for most students who come to the site. It's only here for you to under it out with me if you're interested in medical education or you want to know why we've chosen to do what we do. So I want to start off with the VARK organizer for the different learning styles and move through how to maximize skills and then mitigate skills decline and finish off with Bloom's taxonomy. I'm going to use a little bit of a lingo that's involved in the education theory but I'm going to show you more how it's practically used by us and I'm not going to go deep into some weird pathophysiology of education. But let's start off with the different types of learning models and a pretty well-established model is VARK, which attempts to codify the different types of learners that there are. VARK stands for Visual, Aural or Audio, R is Read-write, and K is Kinesthetic. Now, Kinesthetic doesn't necessarily map very well into an online curriculum. Kinesthetics are going to be those people who like to use the little robot arms to tie a suture but you can see that already likely how we've taken this version of learning styles and ensured that PACE includes something for everyone. Now, people say, oh, I'm not a visual learner, I mean, that's garbage, of course you are, 10% percent of your brain is dedicated to vision, you're a visual learner unless your blind. Right? But what they say is, oh, I'm not a visual learner, I hate lecture, is that that person is probably Read-write predominant. No one is just one but people have different ways of learning and the idea is that we created PACE, we've created OnlineMedEd to satisfy all potential learning styles. So if you don't like PACE but you love the notes and the videos, you can use the notes and videos, it still works, but we've created it in a way that uses audio visual in the way of the videos. Visual Read-write in the way of the notes and note taking as well as Kinesthetic in the way of the questions and the Qbank. In addition, we've also stuck with what we know about adult learner behavior. You'll notice that with some rare exceptions all the videos are less than 20 minutes. This is because that is the average time an adult learner can attend something. Even better when their speed is accelerated to 1.5 or 2X, it feels faster. What you'll notice, if you remember from phase one we said a pretty good student can probably tackle prime, acquire, challenge, in about an hour. The reason for that is its 20 minutes to read the notes, 20 minutes to watch the video and 20 minutes to do the questions and it might take a little longer for a slower learner but the point is, each section, each block is about 20 minutes which is the maximum time an adult learner can to pay attention, unlike the 55-minute long PowerPoint lectures that you probably did in the basic sciences and it also affords an opportunity to break. This is the other thing that we know about adult learners, they can't sit in a classroom for four hours. It doesn't work. No one pays attention and so, at the end of reading your notes you can go cook dinner or make out with your wife or pet your cat or whatever and like you can do whatever you want and come back to the lesson, you don't have to sit there for an hour, you can do it in 20-minute blocks. So we've taken all the different learning styles that someone has and purposefully used, what we know about adult learning behavior to generate PACE. The benefit of this is to maximize skills and then to mitigate skills decline. Let's first talk about maximizing skills. Maximizing skills in this point is basically medical knowledge and a little bit of your ability to take multiple choice questions. I mean that's not really what I wanted to do but it's a byproduct of preparing you for STEP and actually this is not a STEM prep program but this is the foundations for the rest of your life as you'll see we use advanced education principles like blocking and also advanced organizers to help you understand and retain the information, really I'm getting ahead of myself. When you walk in to clinicals you effectively start here and you can still be successful on your own. Right? You know probably your own learning style even if someone hasn't codified for you and so you get to work and you begin to learn. Now, never will you be as knowledgeable and as proficient as you are at the end of residency, medical school, ah, but the point is as you begin to learn you're going to peak and afterwards you're probably just going to decline because you start taking short cuts and you don't keep up the literature, it's okay, you're still doing good, it's just the natural course of learning. So ideally, you'd want to find a resource that takes your slope like this, so that at the same time point, you have learned more and done better. The way we do that is by using repetition, multiple modalities, mapping VARK to prime, acquire, challenge and enforce, notes, videos questions, quick tables, flashcards and it is a blended and integrated approach. Right? These are not elements that have been created separate from each other by different people and we just thrown together and say okay that's the course. No, the people who make the notes, make the videos, make the Qbank, make the quick tables. Yeah, it's me in front of the camera but there are guys behind the scenes making it so everything fits together but this has an extra side effect that is it mitigates skills decline. Let's say we've chosen to do the right thing and learned a lot. Right? So now the person who started at nothing finishes their training having done really well. Now ideally what would happen is you just learn everything and it stays just as good. Getting back to our swimmer, if someone takes a couple of years off from swimming they're probably never going to be a national competitive swimmer again because what ends up happening as you take shortcuts and start to practice and life gets dragged and you don't keep up, what happens is you plummet and that's the natural way things go. Now, you know the phrase, it's like riding a bicycle. If you just ride a little bit more the skills come back, you may not be that you know that competitive athlete that you used to be, but alright but then as you begin to not use the bike anymore you decline and then you start to use it again, okay and so this is what we've unintentionally done by using things like advanced organizers. The color codes, the algorithms, the pictures or the mnemonics, those are a way of creating foundations, the illness script within a disease is set. So that every time you engage chest pain, if you see the little guy with his arms up and the intern book with a guy holding the rifle, this is in the next level topics for medicine. If you see that every time, every time you think about someone with chest pain it's not just do they have coronary artery disease or not it's you're seeing the method and so, you're re-engaging close to where you want to be advanced organizers blocking the material building the foundation allows you to have something to add on as you go through residency you realize truth is actually more important than understanding. Right? You have to know all there is to know about the thing that you're specializing in but in the beginning understanding was more important than truth so you have a baseline. Now, the things you're not going to specialize in it, you're not going to make more robust illness scripts but if you have this framework to attach on details to it's easier to hold on to that information and reengage it. So because we've had you do repetition of alternate modalities and because we use advanced organizers this is really is the foundations for the rest of your life and you go through residency to get the experiential learning to get the details but it's always mapped back on to what we do here and lastly, is Bloom's taxonomy. This is definitely the most nerd alert. Bloom's taxonomy as I see it is a way of maturing someone's ability and I'll break it down into three. There's more than this, but this is how you can simply understand it and the most basic form at the bottom of the pyramid is facts and memorization. Right? What is the dose of metoprolol, 25 milligrams of BID? Simple rote memorization but then you begin to be able to analyze, so you see a case, a person, the history, that forces you to use facts and memorization in a new way to put those things together rather than just regurgitate and ultimately you pass on to synthesis, where you generate new concepts and new ideas on your own without even having to be given a case to begin with. See how this works with OnlineMedEd, at the MS, three, four years, yeah, you have to learn the facts. Understanding is more important than truth, black and white, no curveballs. This is where you're going to see most of PACE. You're going to see prime, acquire and enforce. The quick tables and the flashbacks are literally just rote memorization but then you can start doing challenge here at the analysis phase. The Qbanks are designed to be done after you've read the notes and watch the videos because they want you to get facts and memorization as first and then challenge yourself by doing a clinical vignette that forces you into a situation which you may not have the answer and ultimately, once you get into residency, we have things like clinical cases and the next level content where you make your illness scripts more robust and you actually see real live people who have real live ambiguity that had real live questions come up now on rounds and so, you get to have that experience without actually seeing the person but it takes you, it takes you up the chain to getting into a complete independence and maintaining your skills. This is a little bit on Educational Theory, you're probably not going to get any practical use out of this, so thank you for those of you who watched. Just know that we at OnlineMedEd have used Educational Theory and research to construct our model, we didn't just make it up and it does two things, it gets you learning more faster and also creates a system where you can hang on to that knowledge as you go through life and we've done it based on Educational Theory that exists not just haphazardly thrown in together. That Educational Theory. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Schedules and Expectations]  
﻿What I want to talk about in this lesson is the schedules that you can create using OnlineMedEd content and so far we've talked about how to do questions, the different review materials there are in order to prepare studying the different phases of learning and now I want to get into the practical aspects of how do you actually get it all done? I want to remind you that we've created this integrated blended model where you get different modalities to teaching you the same content that helps it stick and enhances understanding and retention. It's a little extra work reading and watching and doing questions, writing notes but we do it in a way that's purposefully integrated so that it actually becomes more efficient and more effective. The way we expect you to use this course is in the one year plan and I don't mean you're going to be studying for Step two for a year. What I mean is, you're going to be in phase one, the learning phase for most of the year and the idea is you're going to study block by block. The benefit to this method is that you do one lesson per day. It's about one hour for a fast student with a good foundation about two hours for a slower student, so plan accordingly but what you're going to do is PACE. Back to back to back you're going to prime by reading the notes, you're going to acquire by watching the videos and you're going to challenge doing the QBank and eventually at time repetitions you're going to enforce with quick tables and flashcards and in our block it's really easy, right, because you're only going to be studying that subject. I don't want you reading obstetrics when you're doing medicine. So, in obstetrics, you're going to read only the OB-GYN section of the quick tables. So, during the week, you are going to PACE one lesson per day. There's only 225 lessons total, working some time for vacation there and winter or summer recess and you've got about one lesson per day for the entirety of through third year or your clinical clerkships, you come out on the other end having trained up really well and then all you need to do is Taper a little bit and you crush the test. The problem is though that in this block by block method, the duration of the block is going to vary. Some rotations are only four weeks and that's usually things like neuro and psych. Some people have eight week rotations crammed into six weeks and that gets people into trouble because there may not be enough time to do every lesson in the major topic. Most rotations for the cores are eight weeks, things like IM, surgery, Peds and OB-GYN. Now for those people who are fortunate enough to have 12 week core rotations. You're probably going to have no trouble in getting all your lessons done within the block. What I want you to feel is, you're going to be in phase one learning, prime, acquire, challenge and enforce, one lesson per day and of course you're not going to remember everything from the beginning of the year but it's really easy to come out of that, watch something at 2X or blow through your notes real quick and all of a sudden and all comes rushing back because you solidified it so well but in general if you're trying to plan your block what you want to look at is the longer duration blocks. The goal would be to repeat lessons, do the full prime, acquire, challenge and enforce multiple times and include a Taper phase for yourshelf. For example, we've only got 25 topics in pediatrics, if you're on a 12 repeat pediatric rotation, you're going to get through a lesson three times, one lesson per day and that's okay because some other times you're going to like enter medicine where you realize you're going to push it. By the way these schedules are available in your shelf and Step guide on your resource tab in your dashboard. On the contrary, for shorter blocks you're going to be grinding. You may not get through everything, you're only going to be doing each lesson once and this is where it's really important to rest the day before the test, like actually take a break because you're going to be running into the test day having grinding the entire time. So you're going to be able to pick which version you've got and we have some things to help you out but the yearlong plan is the way we intend on you doing it so that you don't feel overburdened but some people come to us when they're already done with clerkships, they haven't heard of us or they didn't use us and they're like, "Hey, I still want to use your curriculum, what can I do to study for Step?" Now if you're intending on using the phases of learning, phase one, phase two, you're going to use PACE and then Taper, people ask me, "How can I do it in four weeks, is that enough time?" No, it's not. If you're only going to spend four weeks, you need to set realistic goals. So, the first thing you want to do if you're coming to us for the first time fresh for step two only is set goals. What I'm talking about is the difference between pass and perform. Fundamentally, what this means is in the pass category what you want to do is get all the same questions right that everyone else is going to get right. To do that, you don't need us, there are plenty of resources that get that done, we're happy to have you, what I want you to feel is that we are more designed for the long haul, the long-term success. To do a pass, really you can do this in less than four weeks and what I recommend you do is go and get a review book and a QBank. You get through that review book once or twice in a month, you do all the questions in a learning manner, take the test but the thing is, that if you really want to perform, if you really want to learn the medicine and have that stick, we'll talk more about this in the educational theory video that follows, you're going to want to try to get a 250 plus you're going to need augmentation. To do augmentation, you have to put in that extra effort and to put in an extra effort realistically, I think you're going to need more than four weeks, this is PACE and then it transitions into a Taper phase. This is doing it the way we intended it only you're accelerating it by doing a whole bunch of lessons per day. So, if you're talking about performance, augmentation, what you're really referring to is you're going to get all the core information, no problem, right? That's going to come up over and over and over again and you can be reasonably sure if it ends up in a review book or in a QBank you're probably going to see it but for augmentation, you're going to have to learn five to six things you're not going to see on the test in order to get one extra point. You need to be honest with yourself. Are you able to keep up with the grueling pace? Are you able to put in eight, twelve hours per day and are you able to do that for an extended period of time? If the answer is no, I still got by Sub-I going on, I want to prepare for Step 2 during my Sub-I. You're just not going to make that, the time to do what you need to do, so keep it simple. But if what you care about is getting the 250 or more, you're willing to put in the time and the effort, well, there's just two different ways you can do this. For Step-Prep, there is the eight week grueling pace where you're going to work 10 to 12 hours per day and you're going to do it six to seven days per week and your goal is to get in six to eight lessons per day. It's going to take you about six weeks. That schedule is printed out for you versus the slightly less grueling version which is going to be the 12 week plan where you're only going to put in eight hours a day and your goal is to get four lessons. Now even when I do remediation and I use this plan within internal medicine no student takes eight hours to do four lessons. They come in and get our early which is fine but they're blocking off enough time to get it done but also not burnout and the idea here, you'll go a little slower have a little bit more breathing room but it takes longer to get through versus the grueling pace. Now we have these resources on your dashboard to help you plan your study strategy but I want to reiterate the best way to use OnlineMedEd is in the phase one learning using it through all your clerkships, learning and consolidating all of that information and then when you come out on the other side having already done it, you just blow through the videos at 2X, Taper through a QBank, get a 250 but if you're willing to put any effort and the time to come do it in a dedicated study period, we're here for you as well. That is Education Schedules. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - The Phases of Learning]  
﻿In this lesson, what I want to talk about are the Phases of Learning. Now, see how that correlates with actually constructing a schedule, whether we're doing it yearlong, three month or two month plan for a shelf or STEP prep, that's the next lesson that follows, in this one, I want to talk about the Phases of Learning and I actually want to actuate it to an athlete. It make sense that a boxer in order to be a competitive challenger would have to be more than the sum of his parts, that is to say once he gets into the ring on the big fight day he's going to need to have done strength training, so that when he hits, he hits hard, he's going to have done speed training and agility training so that when he moves or tries to block, he can, he's also going to need to have done endurance, running bleachers and skipping rope in order to keep up the stamina to go 10 rounds but all the while who also need to have sparred in order to keep up his skills as a boxer. In the same sense, that training, that high intensity, multiple modality training that's effective for athletes can be effective for you when it comes to game day, that is the test, so, we'll talk about phase one which is actuating to modalities, to building a well-rounded athlete but then very much like a swimmer who may train every stroke to practice as a day two hours of practice during the on-season, as the big meet comes up the Taper, the Taper is designed not to lose anything but you're not trying to make any gains either, the idea being during that prep phase, that intense phase, you got to that as competitive of an athlete as you're going to get, and the Taper makes sure you maintain without burning out, both also without losing anything and then the night before, you don't do anything, it sucks to walk into the ring with a pulled muscle, so you take it easy, three phases of being an athlete, three Phases of Learning. Phase one is called the learning phase, this is equivalent to training and the idea is and to be a well-rounded athlete you have to attack the body from multiple modalities, the same is true of challenging your brain to be the ultimate test taking machine, this is effectively PACE, prime, acquire, challenge, and then enforce. That is for each topic as you're going through phase one of learning, you are intended, this is why the pages are set up this way to read the notes, prime your brain to the key issues then immediately the following the notes watch the videos, all the while taking notes into your quick tables in the margins, things you missed or things you didn't understand or some light bulb that went off that may not have gone off before and after you've done the notes and videos in the same session you're supposed to do the Qbank questions that go along with that lesson. The idea is that we are hitting the weight room speed and agility of the boxer correlated to multiple modalities. Now this sounds like a lot of work and you may be surprised to find that doing the same content in multiple modalities is a lot of work but we've done it in a way that is effective and efficient, for an advanced student, someone who has a really good foundation already and has done well on previous multiple choice exams it takes about an hour to get through prime acquired challenge, 20 minutes to read, 20 minutes to watch, 20 minutes to do the questions, for the average student it takes about two hours a day. Now when someone says, man I got to student two hours per day on top of my 12 hours shifts, now you've got the quick tables to bring with you, but yeah, that's the idea by doing it, by using multiple modalities, by repeating the same information but in different ways, you promote understanding and retention, you might get it a little different in one modality to another and in doing so, it clarify topics and the repetition makes it stick, then at specific intervals you're going to engage the enforce. Which is the quick tables and the flash cards, we have it set up so that 48 hours after you do a lesson the flash cards become active for that lesson, 48 hours is the designated time by research that says that's the time to re-engage this stuff you've learned in order to solidify it. During the week you're going to go lesson by lesson, notes, videos, Qbank, flash cards 48 hours later and on the weekends you're going to hit the quick tables, it is a lot of work becoming a competitive athlete but with the materials we give you in a course that's designed to be blended, you're going to get purposeful re-enforcement, it's not haphazard, it's designed this way which makes your studying very effective and time efficient. This is going to be the majority of your study, phase one learning and much like that swimmer, as they prepare for the big meet they enter phase two, phase two is simulation. This is the Taper, the idea here is that sense you've learned everything in the learning phase, you're not going to learn anything new, in fact if you try you're probably just going to lose something else in the way that the swimmer might try to grow before a big meet, he's not going to be a 100% come swim day. So, as you prepare for the test you want to simulate exactly what it's going to be like without trying to learn new things, to do that, you're going to do the day, every day the same way during the Taper. You are going to go to sleep at the same time as you were going to do on testing, you're going to wake up at exactly the same time, you're going to eat the same thing at the same time every day and you're going to feel what it's like to do seven blocks of 44 questions, you are going to do a simulation of the actual test. You want to feel what it's like after two straight blocks, do you need to take 10 minutes every block or can you take 40 minutes after two, when are you going to eat lunch, how much are you going to eat, what's it like if you have a bottle of water extra, you're not trying to learn any new information, you're just practicing with what you got, you're maintaining through the Taper phase and then phase three which people have a lot of trouble with is the rest phase. The day before your test, you should do nothing, you shouldn't study anything else, you shouldn't look at anything, it's all in there. You know you've been using the reinforcement techniques that promotes retention and understanding, you've Tapered through you're ready for the test, you know what it feels like, you know what it looks like, now is the time to chill out, you don't want to pull a muscle before getting in the ring, you also don't want to come in hung over, so don't take it too easy but the idea is try to do nothing and most people can't do nothing, so that rest day is a great day to go through those things that are going to be cramped, things like pediatric milestones or rheumatology, serology the diagnosis, the stuff that just doesn't stick, that's a good time to review those things. And so your study period, no matter how long it is and we'll talk more about that in the next section is going to consist of weeks of studying, you see at the end of Saturday and Sunday, the weekends and the Monday through Friday, Monday through Friday you're going to do the lessons and the lessons are going to be PACE. You get up in the morning you do the flash cards, from the videos two days ago and then you go through the lesson, prime, acquire, challenge one at a time, you're going to do that Monday to Friday. On the weekends, the goal is to read the quick tables. If you're fast you'll get through the whole thing in a weekend, if you're not that fast, you just keep reading from where you left off until the whole thing is read and you cycle through again, the idea is that you're ready, not just the quick tables but the notes you've added. As you approach test day things should get easier, this is test day, the day before test day is rest day and up to that point you've been Tapering, after test day, party or whatever. So, I want you to see, now this might be a little high level and the comparison to athletes may not make sense to everybody but I want you to see that we have designed OnlineMedEds with particularly to do the learning phase, that is the solidify the knowledge in a way that you're not going to forget it, you've learned it well, you've learned it correctly and you're going to remember. We also know that you need the prep for the test to actually train for the exam, not during the Taper phase, you're not going to learn anything new and you make sure you rest one day before, so no matter whether you're planning for a shelf which usually doesn't have much of a Taper phase or for the STEP exam, you can choose your schedule based on how grueling you want to make it and how long you want it to take. That is Education Phases of Learning.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Bias]  
﻿This video is about bias. Bias is anything that affects the outcome of your study that is not what you're to test. There are tons of sources of bias. I'm just going to cover the ones that come up on tests most frequently. If you want a more comprehensive list, take a look at the notes. All right. Let's break this down, based on some sources of bias. Research subjects or study participants are one source. Researchers themselves are another sources, and then there are some biases that are just inherent in doing research, these we'll say come from the study. All right. Bias that comes from subjects. First one that you need to know is Hawthorne effect. Now, in Hawthorne effect people change their behavior because they know that they're being observed. So, observation leads to behavior change. The next one that you need to know is a recall bias. In recall bias, the way that I want you to remember this is that sick patients remember more. So, this happens in retrospective studies, where you have a group of sick patients and a group of healthy people, and you ask them to think back to exposures in their past, and people who are sick are going to think just a little bit harder about exposures that they might have had, out of an eagerness to explain their illness. And the way that you address bias that comes from subjects is with blinding, that's where you don't let them know what group they've been assigned to, and when only the subjects are blinded that is referred to as single blinding. All right. So, biased that comes from the researcher, is a much bigger deal, but fortunately it is also easier to address. The first one here that you need to know about is selection bias. In that selection bias, at baseline the groups that you're comparing are different from each other in a way that they shouldn't be. So for example, if I'm a researcher and I put all of my sickest patients into the group receiving the study drug and all of my healthier patients into the group receiving the placebo. I can't really make a fair comparison at the end of the trial. So that selection bias. You can think of it as, groups are different at baseline, and the way that you address this is with randomization, that is you don't let the researcher pick who goes into what group. You do a coin flip or a random number generator, so that it's based on just random chance, not based on what I want as the researcher. You can't always do randomization, and another tool that you can use to address that is matching. So that's where for every person in the study group you get somebody who is similar to them, who matches them in terms of demographics, and you group them for the comparison group, and the way that you show that you're matching and your randomizations have been successful, is you show that they have similar demographics, and you compare these in a table. All right. Next one you need to know about is observer bias. In observer bias, the researcher knows what group everyone has been assigned to. They know who is getting the placebo and who is getting the study drug, and their knowledge of this impacts the way that they evaluate everybody, consciously or unconsciously. So researcher evaluates, differently, and the way that you address this is you don't let them know what group people are in. You blind them and when both the researcher and the subject have been blinded, this is double blinding. All right. So let's move on to sources of bias that come from just doing research itself. Next one I want to talk about is confounding. Confounding is the most important topic in this whole video, if you learn nothing else, learn confounding. All right. So, what confounding is, is when you have an exposure, and you have some outcome and you see that they are related, so you think, hey, the exposure must be causing the outcome, but you are wrong, because there is a third factor that you did not think about, that is related to both the exposure and to the outcome, and that third factor is distorting the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Let's talk through an example. Bizarrely enough, ice cream consumption is associated with an increase in drowning deaths. So, I might be tempted to say, hey, ice cream consumption causes drowning, but I'm wrong, because I did think about summer. Summer causes ice cream consumption. Summer also causes drowning deaths, and when I count for this fact, the relationship between the exposure and the outcome disappears. That's confounding. Ways that you address this, you can do -- you can do a good study design, or you can do randomization, you can do matching, either one works. Do not confuse this with effect modification. So, effect modification technically is not a bias. So, I'm going to put it in little parentheses here. We need to discuss it here though, because it gets confused with confounding so easily. Let me show you why. Just like with confounding, we have our exposure, and we have our outcomes, and we think that they're related, and there's even a third factor here, and the third factor is associated with the outcome. The difference here, is that the third factor is not related to the exposure, and this is key. The third factor enhances the relationship between the exposure and the outcome. Let's talk through an example. Oral contraceptive pill, OCPs are associated with a small increase in the risk of DBTs. If you look a little bit closer, you see that it is not just the OCPs that is causing the increase in DBTs. It is oral contraceptive, OCPS, and smoking together that causes the big increase in DBTs. Smoking is not really related to OCPs, but when you add smoking to oral contraception, you have a modification, an enhancement of the effect, and that is the key difference here, when you add the third factor, you get a stronger effect. Okay. So, just to do a quick recap, when you have bias that comes from subjects, you want to blind. When you have bias that comes from the researcher, you want to blind again. Double blind. You also can use randomization and matching, and do not confuse, confounding and effect modification. Remember that in confounding, your third factor negates the relationship between your exposure and your outcome, and in effect modification, your third factor enhances the relationship, and that is bias.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Confidence Interval]  
﻿This video is about confidence intervals. If you haven't done this already, I highly recommend that you watch my video on hypothesis testing, and my video on risk before proceeding. Okay. So, let's talk about what happens when you do a study. When you do a study, you have population that you're hoping to make generalizations about. So, this is the whole population, and you collect data from a group of people, this is the sample, and from your sample you calculate a mean, and the mean that you calculate from your sample is a guess. You hope that it is representative of the rest of the greater population that you're trying to generalize about, but you can't be sure unless you give yourself some wiggle room, and the way that you do that is with a confidence interval. Confidence interval, makes you more likely to contain the actual population value that you are trying to make a guess at. Okay. So, now let's think back to the hypothesis testing video. Remember in the hypothesis testing video what we were trying to get at was significance. Was there a statistically significant group -- uh, difference between the two groups, and so the way that we did that, was we were comparing two means, and if our P value, which we calculated from our data, if our P value was less than alpha -- alpha the predetermined cut off for what is statically significant. P was less than alpha, we had reached significance, and if P was greater than alpha, we had not reached statistical significance. So, in order to make a more accurate comparison, the thing that we should do is incorporate our wiggle room. We need to include our confidence intervals. What that would look like, is say means plus wiggle room. So, comparing our two means with a 95 percent confidence interval is equivalent to using a cut off of alpha of .05. 95 percent confidence interval, the same thing, alpha .05. So, now instead of comparing P to alpha, what we're going to check is whether or not our two confidence intervals overlap. So, if we have a confidence interval that looks like this, and another one that looks like this, we have overlap, and when you're comparing two confidence intervals, overlap means that there's not a statistically significant difference between the two groups. You have overlap. So you have no statistical significance. Overlap is bad, it means that your groups are the same. If instead, your confidence intervals are really narrow, and you have no overlap, you have reached statistical significance, because there is no overlap between the two groups that means that your groups are different. All right. So, how do you get skinny narrow little confidence intervals? The way that you do that is with power. Increased power means narrower confidence intervals, it means you are more likely to reach statistical significance, and how do you get a higher power? You get a larger sample size. So you include more people in your study. All right. So, that is how you interpret a confidence interval when you are comparing two means. You get two confidence intervals and you don't want them to overlap. You are actually more likely to get tested on the interpretation of confidence intervals for odds ratios and relative risk, and remember from my odds ratio and relative risk video, that when you have an odds ratio or relative risk greater than one, that means that you have a positive association between your risk factor and your disease outcome, and if you have an odds ratio or relative risk that is equal to one, that means that there is no association, and if you have one that is less than one, that means that there is a negative association, and remember, this is for odds ratio, or relative risk. All right, and so for this, what you want to remember is that you do not want your confidence interval to cross one. So, this is one here, this is zero, it's two, and on, and on. Here's the line that we do not want the confidence interval to cross. So, if you have a confidence interval that is greater than one, and it doesn't include one at all, then you're in good shape. You still have an association between your risk factor and your outcome. If you have one, if you have a confidence interval that is less than one, but still doesn't cross one. Again, you're still in good shape, there still is an association between your risk factor and your outcome. If instead, you have a confidence interval that does cross one, you're in bad shape. There is no association between your risk factor and your outcome. Okay. So to recap, confidence interval, is just wiggle room to make sure that your guess includes the true population value, and when you're comparing two means, you do not want your confidence intervals to overlap one another if you're trying to show that you're groups are different, and in odds ratio and relative risk. You want to make sure that your confidence interval does not cross over one, if you're trying to show that there is a relationship between your risk factor and your outcome, and that is confidence intervals.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Diagnostic Tests]  
﻿Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value are measures of how good a diagnostic test is. There are also really frequently tested concepts, so you need to be comfortable calculating and interpreting them. Your best friend for this is a two by two table. Now, in a two by two table, disease status is always at the top, always. With positive on the left and negative on the right, and the test result will be on the side. Positive on top, negative on the bottom. All right. So, in the disease positive column, these people have the disease no matter what. Regardless, of what their test results says we know that they have the disease. So, if they have a positive test result, if that test is correct, that is a true positive test result. TP for true positive, and if they get a negative test result, that's not correct, that test is wrong, because we know that they have the disease. So this is a false negative. Similarly, for people who do not have the disease, that's the disease negative column. If they get a positive test result, even though they don't have the disease, the test is wrong. This is a false positive test result, and if they get a negative test, that test is correct, because they don't have the disease. So this is a true negative test result. All right. We are going to use these to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Let me just write these down. I'm going to write sensitivity down here at the bottom of the positive disease column. Specificity over here by negative diseases, positive test result gets positive predictive value, and negative test result gets negative predictive value, and when we calculate these four equations, what I want you to remember is that true is going to go on the top, and sum is going to go on the bottom. True on top, sum on the bottom. Let me show you -- let me show you what I mean. We'll start with sensitivity. Sensitivity, like I mentioned, is at the bottom of the positive disease column. So we're only looking at people who have the disease and within this column, true goes on top. So the true value here is true positive. That's going to be our numerator. True on top, true positive. Our denominator is the sum. Sum goes on the bottom. That's true positive and false negative. Sensitive tests frequently get used as screening tests. This is because they rarely miss the disease, and in fact, a test that is perfectly sensitive will never miss the disease. Unfortunately, sensitivity doesn't tell us anything about the rate of false positives, and also unfortunately, a lot of really sensitive tests have high rates of false positives. So, an example here would be Pap smears screening for cervical cancer, and if you have a positive Pap smear that means that cervical cancer is a possibility. That said, lots and lots of women have positive Pap smears and then when you do colposcopy, they end up not having cervical cancer. These are false positive test results. This is where specificity is helpful. So, specificity, remember, we are looking at the disease negative column. We're looking at people who do not have the disease, and remember again, true is going to go on the top, and the sum is going to go on the bottom, and so true within this column, is true negative, and our sum is true negative, plus false positive. Specific test frequently get used to confirm a diagnosis after you have a positive screening test, and this is because specific tests give very few false positives, and in fact, a test that is perfectly specific will never give a false positive. So, if a good example of a sensitive test is Pap smear, then a good example of a specific test would be colposcopy. So, to recap, sensitive tests are good because they don't miss the disease, and specific tests are good, because they don't give false positives. Now, there is a pneumonic that gets used frequently, that I find pretty confusing, but it gets used all the time. So, we're just going to go over it really quickly, that's spin and snout. So, let's start with snout. So for snout, you write SN for a sensitive test, SN -- SN, and then you write N again for negative. So given a highly sensitive test, if negative rules out the disease. So think again of the Pap smear, if you have a Pap smear that is negative, you can be pretty confident that you can rule out cervical cancer. Likewise -- likewise for spin, SP for specificity, you write another P for positive. So given a highly specific test, if it's positive rules in the disease. Thinking back to the colposcopy example, if you have a positive colposcopy, a positive specific test, you should probably be pretty concerned about cervical cancer. All right. Let's move on to positive predictive value. Positive predictive value is at the end of the test positive row. So we're only looking at people who have tested positive. Remembering, that true is going to go on top, the true value here is true positive, and the sum, is going to be true positive and false positive. So, how I like to think of positive predictive value, is it's what your patient is going to want to know if they get a positive test result. So, if I'm your patient, and I get a positive test result, if I show up in your office. I'm going to want to know given my positive test result, how likely is it that I actually have the disease, and another thing that you should know about positive predictive value. This is just one of those weird things that shows up on tests all the time for some reason. It's that with increasing disease prevalence. You get higher positive predictive value, and I just remember this because there are lots of Ps, all the Ps are going in the same direction. High prevalence, high positive predictive value. Okay. Let's move on to negative predictive value. Negative predictive value is here at the end of the negative test result row, and remember that true goes on the top, so our true within this row, it's true negative, and our denominator is the sum, false negative and true negative, and similar to what positive predictive value is, it's if you get a negative test result, you want to know how likely is that you actually are disease free. All right. Let's finish with the word on precision and accuracy. Precision in a diagnostic test requires that you are able to reproduce your results, and that your results are consistent. So, if I am an archer, and I go to the archery range, and I'm shooting at a bull's eye, and if all of my arrows kind of go pretty close together, around the same exact spot, really, really tight distribution, but none of them hit the bull's eye. I'm precise, but I'm not accurate. Precision, it does not require that your test measures what it intends to measure. It just measures that you can repeat it really, really consistently. However, with accuracy, your test needs to measure what it says that it's measuring. So, this would be, if I went to the archery range and I was getting a lot of arrows in the bull's eye, but not necessarily all in the bull's eye. In fact, they can be pretty spread out, and it will still be called accurate. As long as it's centered on the bull's eye, and I'm getting them in the bull's eye, that's considered accurate, it's just not precise, because I'm not reproducing my results really well. So, this is accurate. Now, ideally you have a test that is both precise and accurate, and that would look like this, where you get a nice tight distribution, all in the bull's eye. This is both precise and accurate. So, that's precision and accuracy. Let's just summarize really quickly the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. Just remember, that these are really important concepts, and you definitely need to be really comfortable of reproducing this table. Do not forget the disease status goes on top. Test result, goes on the side, and the positives, go in the top left corner. You should also remember, that sensitivity is going to be referring to people who have a disease, and specificity, is going to be referring to people who do not happen disease. Likewise, positive predictive value, refers to people who have a positive test result, and negative predictive value, refers to people who have a negative test result, and finally, when you are deriving all of these formulas, remember, true goes on the top, and the sum goes on the bottom, and that's it for diagnostic tests.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Hypothesis Testing]  
﻿This video is about hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is an important tool in medical research and it's also a fair game for your boards. So in medical research we're often trying to compare two groups. For example, say I want to study a new blood pressure medicine. One way that I could do this would be to get a group of people and give them the study drug and get another group of people and give them a placebo, and then compare the average blood pressure between the two groups. So the question that I'm asking is, is group one equal to group two or are they different? So these comparisons can be a little bit tricky, because sometimes groups are different just by luck of the draw, so just due to random chance I might pick a group of people for group one who has a lower average blood pressure than the people in group two. The question in statistics then becomes, if there is a difference between the two groups, is that just due to random chance? And so the way that we go about addressing this is with hypothesis testing. We're going to start with a hypothesis that most researchers secretly hope to be true, which is that group one does not equal group two. Researchers want this, because they usually want to show that there is a difference between the groups. They want to show that the people who got the study drug have a different outcome, have better blood pressure than the people who did not. So the way that we test this is with another statement that we hope to prove false, which is that group one equals group two. They are the same, they have the same outcome, and this is referred to as the null hypothesis, which is written with a big H and a little subscript zero. You can think of the zero as being for zero difference between the two groups, and this, the first statement, the one that researchers are usually secretly hoping for, this is the alternative hypothesis. This is what we want and this is what we test, and something that I want you to notice is that these two statements are mutually exclusive, that means if one of them is true the other one is false, they cannot both be true. Now that we have our null hypothesis, we need to decide whether or not we think that it's true. If we think that it is not true that is called rejecting the null hypothesis, and the way that we decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis is with something called a P value, and P value is calculated using our data. So we plug our data into some statistical software and outcomes the P value, and if the P value is small, that means that we get to reject the null hypothesis. We're betting that this is not true, we're betting that this is true, that there is a difference between the two groups. So when P is small we get to reject the null. If instead, P is large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We're stuck with it. We have to say that the groups are not different. So a smaller is better for P values, if you're trying to show that groups are different. So how do we decide what counts as small? The way that we do this is with something called Alpha, which is the significance level, and by convention and biomedical research this is set to 0. 5. This means that we are willing to accept up to a five percent chance that the difference between the two groups is due to chance alone. So we're willing to accept up to a five percent chance that the difference that we observed between the two groups is not due to the study drug, but actually due to just random chance. So alpha is the cutoff level where we decide whether P is small or large. If P is less than alpha if it is smaller than 0. 5 that means that we get to reject the null, and if P is greater than alpha, that means we failed to reject. So when P like I said is less than alpha, that means that we have reached statistical significance. This is what people are going for when they do research, and the way that this is denoted sometimes is with little stars, so we'll give this P a star. Researchers are always running around trying to get the smallest P possible. Remember that a smaller P is better if you're trying to show that there's a difference between groups, and if you're having a hard time getting that to stick in your head, remember that in statistics a small P makes a big difference. Okay. So -- so far we've been talking about rejecting the null or failing to reject the null based on our data. We calculate P and we compare it to the preset alpha and we're trying to make a decision. We're making a guess and this is a little bit weird to think about, but since we've been making a guess that means it's possible that were wrong. We could be guessing that the groups are the same when the reality is that they're different or vice versa, and if we're guessing wrong or making an error. There are two types of error that you need to know about, let's just talk about them with a table. On the top of our table, we'll talk about the truth about than null hypothesis. So the null hypothesis -- the null hypothesis can either be true or it can be false. This is the reality, this is what we don't necessarily know, this is what we're guessing at. So on the side, we're going to put our guess, and the guess that we make is based on our hypothesis testing. So if we do our hypothesis testing we get a large P, we fail to reject the null, and what that means is that we are guessing that the null is true, T for True, and if we get instead a small P and we reject the null hypothesis, what we are doing is we are guessing that the null is false. Okay. So let's start in the universe where the null hypothesis is in reality true. Regardless of what our data actually tell us. The null hypothesis is true. There actually is no difference between them. If we use our data to guess that the knoll is true, we're correct, we made the right decision. If instead we guess that the null hypothesis is false, still in the universe where the null hypothesis is in reality true, we've made an error. This is called Type 1 Error. Type 1 Error is rejecting the null hypothesis even though it's true. The probability of committing this type of error is equal to alpha. It's actually the same alpha that's here. So if this is alpha, the probability of this is one minus the alpha. All right. Let's move on to the universe where regardless of what our data end up telling us, the null hypothesis is false. There actually is a difference between the two groups. If within this universe where the null hypothesis false. We make a guess that the null hypothesis is true. We have again committed error. We've committed a Type 2 Error, and the probability of committing a Type 2 Error is equal to beta. All right, and if in this reality where the null hypothesis is false, we guess that the null hypothesis is false, we're correct again, and that this is equal to one minus beta, and this actually has a name. This one minus beta or the probability of guessing that the null is false, when it actually is false, and this is referred to as statistical power. Power is a good thing, we want it to be high. It's actually an indicator of the likelihood that we're going to make the right decision here. So the thing that I want you to remember about power is that it increases with larger sample sizes. So a bigger study with more people means greater statistical power. All right. So to recap, hypothesis testing is how we decide whether or not two groups are different and we do that by comparing a P value which we calculate from our data to alpha. If P is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis, and if it is larger than alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If we reject -- if we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true, we have committed a Type 1 Error and if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, when it was actually false we have committed a Type 2 Error, and finally power increases with increasing sample size, and that is hypothesis testing.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Prevention]  
﻿When you think of prevention, what you usually think of is never getting the disease in the first place, but actually it's a little bit more convoluted than that, and I want to go over some vocabulary, and then solidify it so that you know what type of intervention is what type of prevention. You'll see what I mean in a minute. There's three degrees of prevention, primary prevention is what you think of as the lay term of prevention, that is you prevent the onset of disease. We're going to use an example of hypertension here through this and then we'll get into more details at the end. The idea here, is that a normal patient may progress to having hypertension. Primary prevention, would intervene to keep the person normal. That is they never develop hypertension in the first place. Secondary prevention, is all about detection. They have the disease, what you want to do is delay progression. That is the person who has hypertension will be prevented from developing the sequela of myocardial infarction. Tertiary prevention, is not prevention at all. This is preventing the complications that arise of that's a sequela. In this case, the myocardial infarction would lead to CHF. Now, it can become a little convoluted, about which one is which, but there are some things that come up a lot, that are going to then help you label which one it is, and if you just memorize it and try to figure it out. You can get some points on the test. In life, you're just going to do these things, it doesn't matter what you call them you're going to do them all, but as it comes the testing you might find yourself caught trying to pick primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary prevention is what you want to do. Primary prevention is all about reducing exposure. You know a certain exposures cause diseases, we generally call them risk factors. The goal here is to reduce exposure in the first place. Examples of primary prevention are going to be things like, weight loss, smoking cessation, reduce alcohol intake, and eating better. Now, eating better isn't meant to be intentionally vague, because this is a touchy subject, but of course, more leafy greens, more vegetables, more organic stuff better than fast food and processed foods. Primary prevention may also be in the form of a therapy though. Right, so primary prevention may include vaccination. The idea is, that we either prevent any problem from coming if they get exposed or we reduce the exposure overall. Secondary prevention, is more about screening and early intervention. Screening and intervention is going to be achieved with screening tests, and to be a good screening test, you generally want to be sensitive. That is will tolerate false positives, so that we don't miss false negatives, and when we identify a disease early, we intervene generally in the form of lifestyle modifications, of course, but often medications. To use a concrete example, diabetics who are diagnosed with an A1C of 7.1 are put on oral medications and asked to exercise. Their A1C may fall to non-diabetic levels. You got a diabetic diagnosed with an A1C of 14, and you need to put them on multi-daily injections of subcutaneous insulin. They're likely to get worse. So secondary prevention is about finding disease early through screening tests, and intervening before they become a problem. Tertiary prevention is about treatment of disease. This is going to be achieved through lifestyle modifications, but usually that is not enough. So tertiary prevention is almost never a lifestyle, at this point it is going to be through treatments, and is generally considered more responsive than preventive, and here I'm talking about neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Aspirins, statin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor for coronary artery disease, after the stents been placed with clopidogrel. Tertiary prevention, is what you do when you treat disease. Secondary prevention is figuring out that they have it in the first place and trying to get rid of it. Primary prevention, is reducing the exposure so they never develop it in the first place, and to get on my soapbox a little bit here, primary prevention costs very little. It's usually just talking to somebody doesn't involve anything, except maybe a vaccine. Secondary prevention costs a little bit more, that screening colonoscopy or the fact that you end up treating someone with stage one hypertension, but the big deal is tertiary prevention active therapy is the most costly. Chemotherapy for drugs, frequent bouts to the hospital. The idea being that, those who are in tertiary prevention are the ones we're going to cost the most, and the reason in our country, that 99% of our healthcare dollars goes towards one percent of the population, is because that one percent is here. They have severe disease, they're barely hanging on, and we're giving all the therapy we can to keep them alive. Whereas, those people who were healthy and stay healthy don't cost anything. That's prevention. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Risk]  
﻿This video is about risk. Risk is a measure of incidence of disease. We're going to be focusing on odds ratio and relative risk, which explore the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and development of a disease. The first thing that we need to do though is talk about probability versus odds. Those terms get used interchangeably in everyday life, but they actually mean something slightly different. Let's talk through an example. One out of every 10 people in the US is left-handed. So if we want to calculate the probability of being left-handed, the way that we do that is by comparing the number of events to events plus non-events, and what we mean here by events is the number of people who have the thing that we're interested in. The number of left-handed people and if it's one out of every 10 people the number of events then would be one, there's one event, and then the number of events again would be one and then the number of non-events would be the number of people who are right-handed. So it'd be nine. So probability of being left-handed is one for events, over one for events, plus nine for none-vents, compare that to odds. To calculate the odds of being left-handed, I would compare the number of events to the number of non-events. So one for events, because there's one left-handed person, and then nine for non-events, because they're nine right handed people. Something that you should know about probability and odds is that they approximate one another when you are looking at a rare disease, and that is because the number of healthy people or the number of non-events is really high, so these numbers would both be high, but the number of events, the number of people who have the disease, this would be really low. So basically you end up looking at just the number of events to the number of non-events when this number is really small. So let me repeat, odds and probability approximate each other with rare diseases. Okay. So that's the difference between probability and odds. I know they're really similar, but they're going to be used differently in odds ratios and relative risk. Let's start by using a table to understand the difference between odds ratio and relative risk. So, we're going to do a two by two table that's going to look pretty familiar. There will be disease status on top whether or not somebody has the disease with positive in the top left corner and negative on the right, and on the side will be exposure status, whether or not somebody has been exposed to a disease. Positive on the top, negative on the bottom. If this looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen something really similar when looking at sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, and so far they are identical except for exposure status is on the side whereas in the other one, the test result is on the side. All right. Now to fill these in, you have A and B, and the disease or in the exposure positive row. A and B in the first row, C and D in the exposure negative row, in the row people who have not been exposed, A, B, C, D. Remember to always put this table together the same way with disease status on top, exposure on the side, A and B in the first row, and C and D in the second row. Okay. So let's use these to talk about odds ratio and relative risk, finally. So when you do a cohort study, what you do is you get a group of people who have been exposed to a risk factor, you get another group of people who have not been exposed to a risk factor, and you follow them over time to see who develops the disease, and in order to make that comparison you use something called relative risk, which I'm going to abbreviate RR. So relative risk gets used for cohort studies. So what this is looking at is the probability of getting the disease in people who have been exposed over the probability of disease in people who have not been exposed, and we're using probability here, so we're going to be using events over events plus non-events to calculate what goes next. So, let's start with the numerator here. We need to find the probability of disease in people who have been exposed. So we're only looking at people who have been exposed, we're only going to be looking at A and B because this is the population of people who have been exposed. So we need to find what are the events and one of the non-events here. So the events would be who has the disease. So A is the events. A over everybody who's been exposed, A and B, events and non-events. A plus B. So just to repeat the probability of people of getting the disease in people who have been exposed is A over A plus B. Now we're going to look at the probability of disease in people who have not been exposed, so we're only looking at C and D. This row of people who have not been exposed, and we're going to find that the number -- we're going to find the events, and the events here again is the people who have the disease, so it's going to be C, and then that means that the non-events is D. So it'll be C over C plus D. This is relative risk. Compare that to odds ratios, which I'll abbreviate OR, which are used for case control studies. In a case control study, you start with a group of people who have the disease that you're interested in, and then you also get a group of people who are -- who do not have the disease that you're interested in and you look back and you ask them, were you exposed to this risk factor? And then you compare between the two, and like I said the way that you make this comparison is with odds ratio. So the way that you calculate odds ratio is unsurprisingly using odds rather than probability. So you find the odds of a positive exposure in people who have the disease over the odds of having the exposure and people who do not have the disease. All right, and so what is -- how do we calculate the odds of exposure in people who have the disease. We need to look first at people who have the disease, so we're going to be looking at this column, and here we need to again find what is the event and what is the non-event, but we want to know who was exposed. So positive exposure is our event and negative exposure is our non-event. So the odds of exposure and people who have the disease would be A over C that is our numerator A over C. Events over non-events, and then the odds that exposure in people who do not have the disease, we need to look in the disease negative column, and that's B and D, and so which one is the event here? The event here again would be positive exposure, because that's what we're interested in. So it would be B for events over D for non-events. B over D. We have A over C, over B over D, and then this simplifies to A, D, over B, C. That's odds ratio. Okay. So let's talk about how you interpret these. The interpretation for odds ratio and relative risk for our purposes is essentially the same. You're trying to figure out what is the relationship between the exposure and the disease. Does the disease come from being exposed? So if you have an odds ratio or relative risk that is greater than one, what that means is there's a positive association between being exposed to something and getting the disease. So there's a positive association. An example might be smoking as your exposure and COPD as your disease status. People who smoke are more likely to get the COPD. If your odds ratio or your relative risk is equal to one that means that there is no association between exposure, and the outcome, and the exposure and the disease. So, an example if we still are using smoking would be, smoking and say getting a bunion. As far as we know, there's no relationship between somebody smoking and then getting a bunion. So we would expect one to be our answer. So if you then get an odds ratio or relative risk less than one that means that there's a negative association. That means that, if you're exposed to the risk factor you are less likely to get the disease, and if we're still using smoking, our example could be smoking and ulcerative colitis. For some reason, smoking is protective against the development of ulcerative colitis. So there is a negative association. All right, and that's the interpretation. The next thing that we need to talk about is, the number needed to treat a number needed to harm. Number needed to treat, is the number of people that you need to expose to some sort of treatment in order for one person to benefit. Ideally every person that you give treatment to would get some benefit from it, but in reality that's not how things actually work. Usually you need to give a lot of people warfarin in order to prevent one stroke. That's similar to number needed to harm. Number needed to harm is how many people do you need to expose to some sort of a risk factor in order for one person to be harmed by it? So how many people need to be taking warfarin, in order for one person to experience an adverse bleeding event? Now the way that you calculate this, is a little bit interesting. The number needed to treat is equal to one over ARR, and that stands for absolute risk reduction, and number needed to harm is equal to one over AR, which is attributable risk. ARR and AR, honestly are not that important, they just don't come up on test that much. We're going to go over, how you calculate them, but only because you need them in order to get to number needed to treat and number needed to harm, which are the more important things that we're talking about. So let me just make a box around this so you remember, number needed to treat a number needed to harm are the important things to remember. Okay. So, to calculate absolute risk reduction, ARR. What you do is you take C over C plus D, which is the probability of having the disease in people who have been exposed, minus A over A plus B, which is the probability of disease in people who have been exposed. Just to note, this is the same thing as this, and this is the same thing as this. If that helps you remember, great. If not, don't worry about it, and attributable risk, AR is just flipped. So then, it would be A over A plus B, minus the C over C plus D. I'm going to go over one more thing really quickly, it's relative risk reduction RRR, but this is just equal to one minus relative risk. That's really all you need to know about for relative risk reduction. All right. So to review, make sure that you know the difference between probability and odds, and definitely, make sure that you can recreate this table exactly with disease status on top, and exposure on the side, positive in the top left corner, A, B, C, D. Always the same. Make sure that you can remember how to calculate relative risk, and remember that it goes with cohort studies, make sure you can calculate odds ratio, and remember that it goes with case control, and remember how to interpret. Specifically remember, that if you have an odds ratio relative risk equal to one, there is no association, and that is risk. Become a better doctor.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Screening]  
﻿When we screen people, what we're trying to do is capture disease under the bell curve. Population statistics is about finding out what's good for society. That is, we don't want to do too much, but we want to be able to catch enough disease to help a bunch of people. So what we've come up with are screening guidelines based on studies we've done that tell us these things are good to do, because by doing them more people benefit and less people get harmed. You of course have to consider the number needed to treat, that is, how many times do you have to do this for someone to benefit versus the number needed to harm, how many times you need to do this for a complication, and then compare how bad the complications are relative to the perceived benefit. You don't have to do any of that. In this lecture let's just talk about what you do to screen, know what diseases, how to do it, and when to start. Two things, cancer and medical disease. Let's start off with cancers first. Cancer, when you start screening, how you screen, and when you stop. The most important cancer for the test is colon cancer, and you want to start screening for colon cancer at age 50 or 10 years before the first diagnosis. That is if your father got diagnosed with colon cancer at 42, you should be screened 32, age 50 or 10 years before the first diagnosis in a primary relative whichever one comes sooner. The reason why I put colon cancer at the top is because the way you screen is the most complicated, and any of these count, but if you change the number of frequency of year, you can make a right answer wrong or a wrong answer sound right. The best thing that you can do for colon cancer screening is a complete colonoscopy, and that is done every 10 years, but you can also do a flex sig every five years with fecal occult blood testing every three years, or you could do a fecal occult blood testing every year. Now you can see how they can see these words and then change the years and really screw you up. So as you remember this, colon is ten, flex is five with an FOBT three, FOBT one. Ten, five, three, one. It's in descending order. All of these are fine, and I use FOBT, fecal occult blood test to mean anyway of examining the stool for microscopic blood. You're going to hear about the FIT. For you, it is essentially the same as fecal occult blood testing. It doesn't matter which one you do, they are the same. You're going to continue colon cancer screening until 75, but there's pretty good evidence you should continue past 75, but for certain people. The idea is it takes about 10 years to develop from a polyp into cancer, which is why the colonoscopy is 10 years and you start 10 years from the first diagnosis. If you're going to live more than 10 years, you should probably have colon cancer screening continued. So definitely do colonoscopies until 75 and until 85 if they're really healthy. After that, don't put them through any unnecessary test. The next big cancer is breast, and the way we screen for breast cancer has changed a little bit, and you may still see people prescribing the old way of doing it. The test, that way is wrong even though some societies still recommend it, we are going to use the new recommendation. The old recommendation was to begin at 40 and screen every year. This is no longer the case. What we do -- do now is 50, begin age 50 and then screen every two years with mammography. The idea is something like this, if you do 40 Q1 [phonetics] you will catch more breast cancer, and that person that you found positive before age 50 may benefit, but this is about populations and statistics is about population level and cost-conscious care. Your patient in front of you may have a cancer and you don't diagnose it, but the problem is that the number of patients that need to receive that 40 Q1 actually harms more women than it helps. Women were going through lumpectomies and biopsies leading to abscess and lymphedema such that a false positive rate was too high causing too much morbidity. So 40 Q1 does catch more cancer, but isn't worth it at a statistics level, the population level. 50 Q2 balances, catching women with breast cancer, but reducing the morbidity associated with false positives. You continue until age 75. The other female cancer we screen for is cervical. The right answer is to start cervical cancer screening at age 21. The age at which you began having sex is absolutely irrelevant. Again, population under the bell curve. If you have a high-risk patient, like someone who has had AIDS since they were born and are now sexually active at 11, you might want to screen her for cervical cancer, but again, what likely happens in the general population is that even those girls who are exposed early on in adolescence clear the virus and don't have an increased risk. Therefore, the age of onset doesn't matter. Age 21, the way you screen is with a Pap every three years, and you continue doing Pap smears until either she's age 65 and has three consecutively normal Paps, or she had her cervix cut out, total abdominal hysterectomy. Now, there is another option that you can use for old women. I want you to learn 21 Q3. If you -- if you take a woman who is slightly older, you can do pap Q5 with HPV testing Q5. I don't want you to learn that, because it becomes more complicated and it's actually hard to read in the board intentionally. I want you to learn 21 Q3, but know in the back your head that there's this other option, and if you do HPV testing you can kind of delay them a little bit. That's more for women comfort rather than cervical cancer screening. The last cancer we screen for, that's right we only have four. The last cancer we screen for is lung cancer, and the people we screen for lung cancer are those between the ages of 55 and 80, and they have a 30-pack year history, and they quit less than 15 years ago, and that is including those who are still smoking. The way you screen for lung cancer is a low dose CT scan, and you do that every year. You do that until they're either age 80 or the time that they quit is more than 15 years ago. Note that doing an x-ray does not help with lung cancer. So you should not do them for screening. If you're going to screen someone for cancer, low dose CT. Now, I also want to point out some of the cancers that we do not screen for. Some you might be looking for them. We do not screen for prostate cancer. We used to do digital rectal exams plus screening PSAs, and some cancer society still recommend doing this especially for those who are high-risk, those who have someone who in their family who had prostate cancer. You should learn, do not screen. The reason why we don't do this anymore is the lead time bias. This is the same timeline of exactly the same person. Here they are now. They are going to die at exactly the same time. Their fate is fixed. What happens when we screen someone for prostate cancer is that we find prostate cancer, and so they live all this time with prostate cancer. If we didn't screen for them, they're still going to die the same time. We find that prostate cancer very close to their death, and so it looks like we've prolonged life. You've reduced mortality. This is the lead time. It turns out you die with prostate cancer, not from. Are there patients who will die from prostate cancer, of course, but at a population level it isn't worth it, because you put so many men through unnecessary procedures and biopsies leading to erectile dysfunction and incontinence that it's not worth it. The right answer is discuss with your patient whether or not they should, but really, what they're saying is don't screen for prostate cancer. The other thing to not screen for is ovarian cancer. We tried a lot of things. Serum markers and CA125, imaging with transvaginal ultrasound, and it turns out what happens is you get disease in very late stage, and it doesn't matter that you screen, because they're going to die anyway from their advanced disease. So don't screen ovarian cancer unless they're BRCA positive. More than that on the general surgery breast lecture. That's cancer, colon, breast, cervical, lung. Colon is 50 Q10, breast 50 Q2, cervical 21 Q3, lung cancer 55 to 80 who have smoked 30-pack years and quit less than 15, CTQ1. Let's change gears and go over medical disease. In the medical disease, you want to know what disease we're talking about, who you screen, and how you screen. There are three one-time diseases that you are going to see on your test, not maybe all three of them, but at least one. The first is the male disease and that's abdominal aortic aneurysm. You are going to screen those men who are greater than 65 and who have ever smoked. It's men and over 65 and who have ever smoked, unlike lung cancer, the pack here isn't considered. The way you screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm is with an ultrasound of the abdomen, but if the person has already had abdominal imaging, CT scan of the abdomen for example, for another reason, that counts. One-time screen after 65, look for the aneurysm. Its counterpart in women it is osteoporosis. You're going to screen women who are over the age of 65 and it's all women, and you're going to do that with a DEXA scan. You're testing their bone mineral density. If you have a negative score, what you're looking to do is treat her for osteoporosis with bisphosphonates. You're going to have the option for vitamin D, vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D and calcium are prophylactic and should be done after menopause. Vitamin D, 50,000 units per week should be done if there's vitamin D deficiency, but if you find a positive DEXA scan that is she does have osteoporosis, treated with bisphosphonates. That's the right answer, and the one that's gained a lot of ground, men and women, is Hep C, and it's Hep C because we have a treatment for it. Anyone who is a baby boomer gets screened once. Now, it makes sense to me that you would do more than that. People use needle drugs, have HIV, but the USPSTF has a recommendation, the Hep C antibody is reserved for everyone who is born between the ages of 1945 and 1965. One-time screen. This next few are going to be just general health screening which is still useful, but these are the ones come up on the test most often. HIV, everybody gets a screen once, and you do it through an ELISA. If the ELISA is positive, you confirm before you tell them they have a HIV. It's everyone once and then any time someone wants one. It's called a risky behavior or engagement and risky activity. Really, it means that if someone comes in and requests an HIV test, you give it to them. If you think they might have HIV, you give it to them. If they're sexually active, they can get an HIV screen, screen for HIV, and then some of the cardiovascular diseases, which are very popular on testing, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Hypertension, everyone gets screened every visit. A blood pressure is taken as part of the vital signs and they're screening for hypertension. However, the diagnosis is made two consecutive blood pressures separated by two weeks, because there might be some element of anxiety, panic, rushing, or white coat hypertension, but the best way to diagnose hypertension is ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. That is the person goes home, takes their own blood pressure and writes it down on a piece of paper. That's because the person may have left work, skip a half today in order to go to the doctor, or rushed across town and is very excited and panic that they're late and would be made to wait 30 minutes in the waiting room and finally get their blood pressure. Or white coat hypertension where they come to the clinic, they get anxious their blood pressure goes up. Doing it at home at the same time on multiple days is a better way to diagnose hypertension, and diabetes is surprising, because you think the person who get screened for diabetes would be someone who looks like the type of person who might get it, but the USPTF says people who have hypertension should be screened for diabetes, not obesity, and you do so with an A1C. I want you to hear that the two-hour glucose tolerance test is a thing, but is largely been replaced by the A1C except in the setting of gestational diabetes, where the two-hour glucose tolerance test is a backup to the one and three-hour test. Diabetes, those who have hypertension, get an A1C. Dyslipidemia, now remember, as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, being 45 for a man or 55 for a woman. The numbers are different, but see that 10-degree difference. See why I emphasized 10-degree in a minute. It is said that those who should be screened for dyslipidemia are men greater than equal to 35 all comers or those who are greater than 20 with risk factors for coronary artery disease. See the 10 difference. In women, who are greater and equal to 45, 10 difference, 10 difference, or those greater than 20 with risk factors. This is implying that basically everybody who goes to the doctor is going to get screened for cholesterol, and the way you do that is with a lipid panel, and we know now that the main way to treat dyslipidemia is with statins, and you do everything you can to get them on a statin. To all the things you can do in clinic to help people, especially the elderly, are going to be things that most people miss. Right? So you do want to screen some people especially geriatric population for depression and for mobility. Now, don't worry so much about who, because these are the less strong recommendations, but things you can do are screen people for depression using the PHQ-9. What is that? Don't worry about it. Just know the PHQ-9. Screen them for depression, ask them the questions and see if they have any problems, and the other thing to do is mobility tester, get up and go. Do they have the balance and coordination necessary to pop out of a chair or should they be taking it a little bit slower and maybe need some walking assistance like a walker or cane. Cancer, colon, breast, cervical, lung. Medical disease, AAA, 65 men, osteoporosis, 65 women. Hep C, baby boomers. HIV, everyone. Hypertension, everyone every visit. Diabetes, those who have hypertension use the A1C and not the glucose tolerance test, and dyslipidemia they're going to be everybody, treat with statins. Don't forget about geriatric population or mood disorder and mobility disorders really creep up on them and cause a major impact on their life. That's screening. Become a better doctor.

NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Study Design]  
﻿There are a handful of different study designs that you need to be familiar with, but let's start with incidence and prevalence of disease. Incidence that looks at all the people who are newly diagnosed with the disease in a given period of time. It's typically a year. Compare that to prevalence which looks at all the people who have the disease right now. So if this is everybody, everybody who can possibly have the disease ever, everybody who's at risk and I want to look at how many people were diagnosed with diabetes this year, and it's this little segment right here. This is the incidence of diabetes. Since diabetes is a diagnosis that sticks around for a while, it's a chronic illness, the number of people who have the diagnosis at any given period of time is going to be greater than the number of people who were newly diagnosed. So if I wanted to look at the total number of people who have diabetes right now, it would include the people who were newly diagnosed and then a lot more. It would look like that. So that would be prevalence of diabetes. All right. On to the different kinds of studies. We can broadly break up study design based on whether or not there is an intervention. An intervention is anything that a researcher does to people in the study. It can be a new medicine, it can be a pamphlet, it can be an old treatment, whatever. It's just something that the researcher does or gives to the people in the study, and if there is no intervention, what you have is an observational study, and this can be broken down even further based on whether or not your observational study includes a comparison. If there is no comparison, if you're just describing something, you have a descriptive study and it's going to be one of two that you need to know about. You have either a case series or you have a cross sectional study. A case series is just what it sounds like, it's a series of cases. So this is something where somebody noticed a few interesting people who have a disease and they just wanted to describe it. You get, kind of, a -- you get qualitative information, not really any quantitative data, and it's presented as a narrative. So if a case series is where you just notice something, a cross-sectional study is where you start looking into a little bit more. You start asking questions. In a cross-sectional study, you ask a question of a group of people once at a single point in time. You can do this to assess prevalence. It's like taking a snapshot of traits of a group at that one moment. All right. On to observational studies that have a comparison group. We can break this down based on what are the groups that you're comparing. If you're comparing the same group of people repeatedly over time, what you have is a longitudinal study, and you can think of a longitudinal study as a series of cross-sectional studies. You send out a survey or something once to a group of people and you do it again, and you do it again at the next year, you do it again the next year. It's just a bunch of cross-sectional studies, and this is really useful for assessing change and prevalence. Okay. So for these next two, you have to actually start really paying attention, because the next two study designs that I'm going to talk about are the most important ones of the whole video. So if the groups that you're comparing are people who have the disease that you're looking at versus people who do not have the disease. So you're comparing based on disease status. What you have is a case control study, because cases are people who have the disease and controls are people who do not have the disease, and if you're comparing people based on exposure status, so whether or not they have been exposed to a risk factor. What you have is a cohort study. Now, both case control and cohort studies, they're both looking at the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and then the development of a disease. They're looking at this question from different angles. Let me explain a little bit. So the way that we like to think about disease is that there is some kind of an exposure. Maybe it's to a stressful home environment or it's air pollution, whatever. There's this exposure that happens and then later on you develop a disease. We like to think about with the exposure happening before the disease. In a cohort study, which is prospective. Prospective means looking forward, you start with the exposure. You find a group of people who have been exposed to something and then you follow them over time, and you ask, do they develop the disease? And all the while you've also been following people who have not been exposed so that you can compare them. So in a cohort study you are comparing two groups based on exposure status and for people who have been exposed to a risk factor and people who have not been exposed to a risk factor, which group ends up getting the disease more often, and you do this calculation using something called relative risk. You don't need to know too much more about what relative risk is right now, just try and remember that relative risk goes with cohort studies. I will explain a lot more about it in a later video. Okay. So an example of a cohort study might be something like finding a group of people who have chosen themselves to receive the flu vaccine, and finding a group of people who did not get the flu vaccine this year, and then we follow them throughout the flu season and compare among those two groups which group gets the flu more often. Compare that to a case control study. Case control studies are retrospective that means they look backwards. So the group that we use here for case control is disease status. We start here with disease. We find a group of people with the disease and we ask them, think back in your history, were you ever exposed to this risk factor? And we also ask a group of people who do not have the disease. So an example might be if we were looking at mesothelioma, which is great because it is a rare disease and case control studies are great for rare diseases. So we get a group of people who have the disease, who have mesothelioma, and we also get a group of people who do not have mesothelioma, and we asked both groups, do you remember being exposed to asbestos, and then we compare between those two groups, how often they remember having the exposure, and we make this comparison using something called an odds ratio, and like relative risk, it's important but we're not going to talk about it here. There's going to be another video. Just remember that odds ratio goes with case control. All right so those are the observational studies. Just to note observational studies cannot establish causation. So what that means is you cannot use an observational study to say that an exposure, a specific exposure causes a specific outcome. You can only say that there's an association there. If you want to be able to say that an exposure caused an outcome, you need an intervention, and studies that have interventions are called experimental studies, and just remember, that an intervention is something that a researcher gives to people in the experiment. If you want to have a good experiment, you need to also have something called a control group, and this is to make comparisons. So the intervention receives the thing, whatever it is that the researcher is giving the study group. This is what we're interested in studying. The control group receives anything except for the thing that we are looking at, not the intervention, not the thing. So this can be a placebo, so people think that they are getting the intervention when they're actually not. It can be an existing treatment, usually in the standard of care, or it can be nothing at all. The point is that it is not the intervention, and if you want to have a good experimental study, you should also have something called randomization. This is where you decide who gets the intervention and who gets not the intervention, and you do it just using random chance like a coin flip, and that's how you assign the group, control versus intervention, and really quickly, I just want to mention a type of study called a crossover study. It's really cool. It's where people who were in the control group half way through the study switch and receive the intervention, and likewise, people who were receiving the intervention switch and receive the control, and they cross over, so this is called a crossover study design. This is really cool, because people act as their own control and it is a great way to minimize bias. Now, bias is something that we haven't mentioned yet, but it's really important. It gets its own video, but the purpose of having a control group is to minimize bias, and the purpose of randomizing who goes to what group is also to minimize bias. Bias is bad, we want as little as possible. Okay. Speaking of bias, how much bias an experimental study gets is, kind of, another way that we can break down experimental studies. So it's -- actually we're going to be asking who gets blinded in our experimental study, and what blinding means is hiding the group assignment, and you can blind the patient so they don't know whether they are in the intervention or the control group or you can also blind the researcher so they don't know which group the patient has been assigned to. So if no one is blinded, if everybody knows what group they're in, if the patients know that they're getting the placebo or they know that they're getting the treatment and the researchers know too, what you have is an open label study. Open label studies are not preferred, because they have the greatest risk of bias, because everybody knows what group they're in, but sometimes you can't avoid it, so you're kind of, stuck. What would be better is if you can blind at least the patient. So the patient doesn't know whether they're getting the intervention or they're getting something else. This reduces the amount of bias and this gives you a single blind study. So you have less bias here, but you still have some, because the experimenter or the researcher knows what group. So better still is if you can blind both the patient and the researcher. This results in a double-blind study. These are most preferred, because they have the least amount of bias of these three study designs. So to review, bias is bad and in experimental studies we use control groups and randomization and blinding to minimize bias. Within observational studies, there are two important study designs that you need to be able to tell the difference between and those are case control and cohorts studies. Look out for my video on risk to learn more about these, and that is study design. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[Epidemiology and Stats - Vaccinations]  
﻿This lecture is going to be a pretty quick review of what you need to know about vaccines in America. First thing, if you have foreign travel we're not going to cover those diseases or those vaccines. In pediatrics, in infectious rashes and pediatrics vaccinations, we go over the diseases that are caused by the bugs we vaccinate against. We're not going to do that here. We're going to emphasize adult vaccinations when you need to give them and when you can't. So let's start with that when you can't. What is a true contraindication to somebody getting a vaccine? The first thing you have to look out for and is absolutely contraindication is going to be anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction to a medication or a vaccine. And generally, if you have an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine, you shouldn't get that vaccine again. Most vaccines require multiple doses and so, you find another way to protect that person. The second one comes up a lot is going to be eggs, and egg allergy. And this is because in the past we have grown our vaccines in eggs. And so, people who have a true anaphylactic reaction to eggs were put at risk and said not to have these vaccines. For the most part, we don't make vaccines in eggs anymore strictly because of this purpose. Therefore, the things that used to be a contraindication like the intramuscular flu and the MMRV are no longer contraindicated. The flu IM is a plus minus and so, what we've done is created the flu intranasal, a live attenuated vaccine that can be used if someone has an anaphylactic reaction to the intramuscular version. I'm going to put a dash line through flu intramuscular because very soon you will not have this as a consideration. But one, you still do want to make sure because you don't want to cause an anaphylactic reaction and two, because the test may not have caught up yet to the fact that we're making our flu vaccines free of eggs. I'm going to put a line through intranasal because intranasal is not made in eggs, but it is live attenuated which we'll talk about next. I'm going to put a line through the MMRV which used to be made in eggs and no longer is. That is to say you probably going to have a tough time predicting which vaccine is going to cause anaphylaxis. So it's only those people who have had a bad reaction in the past that is anaphylactic and not just a little red or sore that can't have them. The idea being, give the vaccines. The last thing to consider is the live attenuated. Live attenuated vaccines or contraindicated in anyone who is immunosuppressed. And usually, this means really bad immunosuppression, biologics for transplants, HIV, really old or really young. These vaccines are live attenuated, so that means you can give them the actual virus by giving them the vaccine. But they must be profoundly immunocompromised and they have to go out of their way to tell you, I really shouldn't have this. Someone who's got a CD4 count of four may not take to the vaccine. That is their immune system may not be robust enough to develop the immune response. But if you give someone with a CD count of four a live attenuated vaccine, you may actually inoculate them and give them the disease. The things you want to watch out for for immunodepressed patients is going to be the intranasal flu, the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and zoster. There really isn't a way to get around this, you're going to of course use intramuscular fluid if there's no egg anaphylaxis. If they are profoundly immunocompromised, you should not give them these vaccines. And instead, you should vaccinate them before they become immunocompromised or wait for them to get better before you do. Again, the emphasis here is if you're considering giving someone a vaccine, it's probably the right answer and they should get it. But now I want to talk about the individual vaccines and that is, you want to break it down by vaccine, how often you should get it, when you start and how frequently. And then what really is a problem or a contraindication to getting this particular vaccine. Because we've learned, the global stuff really shouldn't prohibit someone from getting a vaccine. The one you're probably going to get a test question about is Tdap. Not to be confused with the Dtap, also, tetanus toxoid or tetanus diphtheria. This gets very convoluted very quickly which you can see with four options how this could very easily become a test question. The capital D in Dtap is for a much higher dose than in the Tdap. You give a much higher dose when you're trying to prime a weak immune system. Dtap is for kids. Don't pick Dtap for adults. Tetanus toxoid and TD, tetanus diphtheria are the options you have when you can't give a Tdap. These are never going to be the right answer on their own. The CDC even says this, if you have an opportunity to give the Tdap, give it. Which means it's going to be the answer to give the vaccine. What you're supposed to do is give this every ten years for three lifetime doses. And the question you are going to get on the test is going to be, what do you do with the wound? Forget clean wounds, those are easy. What you want to look at is how many lifetime doses they've had and when the last one was. If you've had greater than three lifetime doses, you're good. Which means you can simply clean the wound if it's been less than 10 years since your last one or give a booster if it's greater than 10 years. If you've had less than three lifetime doses, you're going to need to give a booster if it's been less than five years. And the booster plus IVIG if it's been greater than five years. That's a long winded one to understand and we talked a lot about this in the peds vaccination lecture. What I want to see is Q ten years, three doses. And then break it down by how many lifetime doses you've had versus how close are you. And notice I wrote TD. That's the booster. It's okay to use that after you've had a whole bunch of doses and Tdap. But it's also okay to use Tdap when you give a booster. When you have an opportunity to give Tdap, give it. Contraindication here is going to be anaphylaxis. And this is one of those you get a bunch of times, so you'll know if there's a problem. The test question won't do this to you, but if you have a bad reaction to Tdap, which has three things in it, you might drop the acellular pertussis to do the next one and see if a bad reaction occurs. The goal is to prevent disease. And if you lose the acellular pertussis and that's the thing that cause anaphylaxis, you can still give the tetanus booster. A pneumococcal vaccine is actually just as confusing. And so, I'm going to make it simple. What I want you to hear is once before 60 and then once after 65. There's a lot to know in here and I'm carving it down to bare bones. You are going to use the 23 valent for a person who is older than 65. You are going to use the 13 valent for someone who is less than 60. You should complete a 13 series as a child. You can get a 13 again as an adult. The people who need it are those people who have disease, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes. Basically, if you're a medical patient, you need the shot. But the people who absolutely must have it is everybody over the age of 65. Keep it simple, once before 60, once after 65. And those who know a lot about this vaccine know why I'm saying what I'm saying. I want you to remember before 60 and after 65. And just to emphasize the point, you never, never give 13 and 23 at the same time. How would you do that? 13's before 60, 23's after 65. The zoster vaccine prevents shingles, and the recommendation is everybody gets the zoster vaccine regardless of your varicella disease state. That's going to change as the kids who currently get the varicella vaccine don't have chicken pox. You can't get shingles unless you've had chicken pox. But those people who are older than 30, did not get varicella vaccinations and they're going to need zoster. Zoster prevents shingles, shingles hurts, post herpetic neuralgia, bad stuff, everybody who is over the age of 60 needs a zoster shot. Now, zoster is live attenuated. So those who are truly immunosuppressed should wait till they're no longer immunosuppressed in order to get the zoster vaccine. Influenza must be given to everybody. It is everybody every year without fail. Healthcare workers, nursing home residents, show up to the clinic, show up to the Wal-Mart, show to Walgreens, show up to the street corner where they happen to be handing out the flu vaccine. Everybody gets a flu vaccine and it happens every year. Just remember there's this thing plus minus eggs for the intramuscular and live attenuated for the intranasal. You have to have a really, really, really strong suspicion that the interim muscular injections going to cause a problem in order to give it. HPV vaccine prevents cancer. Sounds like a pretty good thing to me. And now, it is indicated for everyone 9 to 26 boys and girls, if boys get vaccinated they can't give it to the girls when they have sex later. If the girls have the vaccine, it doesn't matter of the boys give it to them because the girls are vaccinated against it. It prevents cervical cancer and there's literally no reason not to get it. Specifically receiving the HPV vaccine does not increase sexual activity or risk-taking behavior. Being protected just to keep them protected. In the last one of sort of the adolescent vaccinations is the meningococcal. It prevents meningitis and its neisseria meningitidis, this the one that kills you in 24 hours, so everybody should get this. But the people who must have it are going to be those who are going to be near other people who might have it and kill a bunch of people. That is those in college dormitories and those going to the military, army barracks. In American society, it's everybody, but specifically those who go to college or army barracks. There is no reason not to get this. I do want to revisit some of the pediatric vaccines just in case you hadn't watched that lecture yet to emphasize a few points. Hib causes epiglottitis. If you give the vaccine, kids don't die of epiglottitis. Give the Hib vaccine. Hep A and Hep B vaccines, everybody should get. What I want you to remember is that there are two doses of A and three doses of B. What's important for adults is that if there is a record of Hep A B vaccination and it's incomplete, you can simply complete or pick up where you left off. You do not need to start again. If you have no idea or no records of what their -- Hep A B status is, don't get titers, just revaccinated. And lastly, is the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, everybody gets this. We talk more about the measles mumps rubella varicella vaccine in peds infectious rashes. We talked more about hepatitis B and what to do during birth, during peds vaccinations. We talked more about the Hib vaccine and epiglottitis in the pediatric lectures. Upper airway, HPV is discussed in cervical cancer in the GYN sections, and Tdap is discussed in more detail in the peds vaccinations lecture. So what I want to point out is that there are very few reasons that someone should not get a vaccine. Personal choice is one of them, that's an ethical issue, they should get the vaccine. Everybody should get vaccines. The Tdap is every ten years for three doses total. Worry about the dirty wound thing in that peds lecture. Pneumococcal, once before 60 and once after 65. It's not true, but if you remember that you're going to get it right most of the time. Zoster greater than 60, everybody gets it unless you're immunosuppressed. Flu vaccine, everybody every year, don't worry about that egg thing or you also have the option to use intranasal, which is used when there's an anaphylactic reaction to IM and you are not immunosuppressed. HPV cures cancer before it shows up, we prevent cancer, and everybody gets it. Meningococcal vaccine, everyone should get that one too, but it is necessary for college and the military, and don't forget about the kid ones, you have Hib, epiglottitis, Hep A, B, complete the series wherever you left off, and MMRV prevent these diseases by giving that vaccine. That is preventative vaccinations. Become a better doctor. Subscribe now to get access to our premium content. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Anterior Chapman Points]  
﻿In this lecture, we're going to discuss Chapman's points. And unfortunately, it's nother memorization lecture. Instead of showing a chart, I'm going to demonstrate how I was taught how to draw out the Chapman's points. It's the only thing that worked for me, so I'm going to teach it for you. The Chapman's point is a two or three millimeter papule that represents a viscerosomatic reflex located on the anterior or posterior side of the body. What they are used for now is really to help aid in diagnosis, and not necessarily for treatment. So we're going to go ahead and demonstrate how to draw these things out. So we're going to draw some clavicles and then twelve ribs, and draw our midline. So there are a couple points located around the clavicle and rib 1. You have the ear, the nose and the pharynx. Next we're going to move into the inner space where you have the tonsils, the larynx and the tongue, and finally the sinus. So the next points are going to be outlined in the rib interspaces. So you put a point here, three points here, and then points going all the way back up. You can number your ribs so you know which rib interspace you are in to help you keep these straight. This first dot in the second rib interspace is for the heart. Continue to move down, and this one's for stomach acid. The next is for stomach motility, then you have the spleen. Moving over, you have the pancreas, the liver and gallbladder, another point for the liver, the lower lungs and the upper lung. This final point is almost a grab bag. You have the thyroid, you have the bronchus, you have the esophagus and the myocardium. To finish off the points on the anterior side of your ribs, you can place three points like this. These three points bilaterally are going to represent your small intestine. The next set of points are around your belly button on your abdomen, so this will be your belly button. One inch lateral and one inch superior you have another point, and one inch superior to that is another. These represent the adrenal gland, the kidney and the area around the umbilicus is for the bladder. There are some Chapman's points located in your pelvic area. So imagine this is one of your innominates. You have a point at the pubic tubercle, which represents the ovary and the urethra. And another point located more inferior that represents the uterus. The next points are going to be located on the anterior side of your thighs, and they represent the colon. So we all know how the colon runs, where you have the ascending transverse, descending and sigmoid. Just imagine that and flip it over on itself, and that will represent the locations for the colon Chapman's points on your thighs. So if we're going to draw this out, it will look like this, where we have the cecum, the descending colon, portions of the transverse colon, running back over to the sigmoid like so. Then imagine that our thigh is right here, and this is the rest of the foot, to demonstrate. There's another point back here for the prostate. That's going to be located on the posterior side of your thigh. There are two other random ones that don't really fit into the organizer anywhere, so we're going to have to write them out. So the coracoid will represent the cerebellum, and finally the most random point of all of them, on the lateral superior humerus, that's going to represent your retina and your conjunctiva. So this is how I was taught to remember the Chapman's points. I hope it helps you remember where the Chapman's points are as well, instead of having to memorize the chart. Where we talked about the anterior Chapman's points located in the rib area, if you can see, it kind of makes sense as you go from the superior side of the body to the inferior, you have a group of ENT, then you have the heart and upper lungs, and as you move further down in the body, you're going to reach the stomach, the liver, the pancreas and the small intestine. Everything over here is more difficult stuff to remember. And that's OMM Chapman's points. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Autonomic Levels]  
﻿Autonomics is one of the most high yield topics that we're going to go over in this course. Up until now, we've talked about dysfunction in terms of muscle, bone, attachment, insertion, and things that you can physically palpate. But this is completely different. We're going to be talking about visceral and organ dysfunction and relating that to a somatic dysfunction. So the important concept that you need to be able to do is relate the somatic level of where you may find a dysfunction, and relate that back to a visceral dysfunction or an organ dysfunction. You need to be able to flip that backward as well. If there is some sort of visceral issue, you need to be able to anticipate where you can palpate that as a somatic finding. The visceral organs are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. And the autonomic nervous system can be divided into two sections. You have the sympathetics and the parasympathetics. We're not going to go over what happens to each organ for sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow, but just remember sympathetics are your fight or flight response, and parasympathetics are more rest and digest. So when you're thinking parasympathetics, think pieces on the time. So to start off with, we're going to go over the sympathetic levels. So the way that I'm going to divide this out is I'm going to write out each level and what structures are innervated by it, but I'm also going to draw a picture in the same color to help it stick a little bit better. So we're going to start off with T1 to T6. In this range, you're going to think of the head, the neck, esophagus, the heart and the lungs. So as a picture, you have the head, the neck, the esophagus, the heart and the lungs. So the next level is going to be T5 through T9. When you think of a ganglia here, think of the celiac ganglia. The organs that are going to be innervated for this level include the stomach, duodenum, the pancreas, the liver, the gallbladder and the spleen. So to draw that out, you have the stomach, the liver the gallbladder, the pancreas and the spleen. And finally, the duodenum. So the next level we have T10 and T11. When you're thinking of ganglia here, think of the superior mesenteric ganglia, and for organs being innervated, think about the remainder of the small intestine after the duodenum, the cecum, the appendix, the ascending colon, the first half of the transverse colon, the kidneys, the upper ureters, and finally the gonads. Now you're thinking T10 and 11 for the gonads, why is that? Male gonads are so low, why is it innervated by T10 and 11? So think about embryologically, the gonads begin up in the abdomen around T10 and T11. Throughout the development process, the gonads descend into the scrotal sac, whereas the ovaries just stay where they are. So remember, gonads are strange. T10, T11. So drawing that out, we have the remainder of the small intestine, we have the cecum, the ascending colon and the first half of the transverse colon, as well as the appendix. We also have the kidneys and the upper ureters. So now the final level, T12 through L2. When you're thinking of a ganglia, think of the inferior mesenteric ganglia. When you're thinking of structures that are going to be innervated here, think of the rest of the colon, the lower ureters, the bladder, the prostate and the rest of your sex organs, excluding the gonads. So drawing that out, we're going to have the rest of the colon, the lower part of the ureters, the bladder, the prostate and all of your sex organs except for the gonads. So you're looking at the picture, one thing that you may realize is that everything is innervated in a top down approach. So you have the head and neck, the upper area. You have the upper gastric area, the middle area, and so on and so forth. The only weird part is going to be the GI tract, so you have to think about where exactly the food is passing along the tract as you're eating, to think about innervation levels. And remember, the only really weird one is the gonads. So now we're going to transition over to the parasympathetic levels. This section's going to be a lot easier than the sympathetic levels, because there's only two options. We also don't have to suffer through any more drawings. So the two options that we have are the vagus nerve and the pelvic splanchnic nerves. So how exactly is this divided? One line right there. Everything above the line will have vagus parasympathetic innervation. And everything below it will be pelvic splanchnic. And that's it for parasympathetics, super easy. So how are we going to be treating these? Well, when you're doing autonomic treatments, the main thing that you have to remember is your treatment will not increase outflow. What it's going to do is decrease the innervation facilitation. So when you're doing the treatment, you're trying to decrease the sympathetics or you're trying to decrease the parasympathetic outflow to the area. So for your treatment, you're trying to down regulate the sympathetics. You're going to try paraspinal inhibition. And the most common paraspinal inhibition that students know is rib raising. So if you are trying to decrease sympathetic facilitation to one of these organs, you go to the level and you perform the rib raising treatment. You can also perform a direct ganglia release. The ganglia are the ones that we outlined. So direct ganglia release. So how about parasympathetic? It's going to be different if you're trying to treat the vagus or the pelvic splanchnics. So vagus, you're going to want to treat the OA, and for the pelvic splanchnics, you're going to want to treat the sacrum. When you're treating the sacrum, you're going to think of inhibitory techniques. So you can think of sacral rocking and facilitation maneuvers. So the autonomics, the important thing that you have to know is being able to relate the visceral dysfunction back to your somatic level finding. You also need to be able to flip it and say if you find a somatic dysfunction in a certain area, they might be trying to point you toward some sort of visceral dysfunction. So we went over all of the sympathetic levels, suffered through another picture, and then talked about the parasympathetics and the treatment style. And that's OMM for autonomics. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Cervical Spine Diagnosis and HVLA]  
﻿In this lecture, we're going to be talking about the cervical region. This lecture is going to be divided into two parts. The first part is we're going to learn how to diagnose the cervical vertebra, and then we're going to move into an important muscle that's also located in the neck, the sternocleidomastoid. So in the previous video, we just found out how to diagnose the thoracic spine. Why do we need to learn it again? So doing the same diagnostic pattern for the cervical spine will not work. It's going to be different. And it's different because there's no Fryette's laws. So when you're diagnosing the thoracic spine, you cannot use Fryette's laws. You have a completely different set. So before we go into that, we have to know what the primary motion of each cervical vertebrae is. So your first area is C0, which is also known as the OA. The primary motion of this segment is flexion and extension. This will come into play when we start doing our diagnostics. So the next one is C1, which is also the AA. Primary motion here is rotation. Then you have C2 through 4. The primary motion is also rotation. And then you have the bottom cervical, you have C5 through C7. The primary motion here is going to be side bending. So how is the diagnostic pattern different? You're going to go through the same flow of assessing in neutral, assessing in flexion and assessing in extension. But instead of looking at rotation, you're going to be looking at translation and side bending. And the rules that that's going to follow is going to be on this chart. So for C0 and C1, side bending and rotation occur in opposite directions, meaning that if on an exam or in the clinic you're palpating the area and you notice that the patient can side bend to the left, you know that rotation is in the opposite direction. So they can rotate to the right. When you're assessing for this side bending, you're going to use what's called translation. So what is translation? Imagine that you're palpating the back side of the cervical spine. What you're going to do is you're going to use your fingers and push side to side on the cervical spine. So you're translating from one side to the other. So if I'm pushing from the right to the left, this is going to be left translation. But this is where people will get tripped up. You're doing left translation, but when you're making that motion, the cervical vertebra collapse to the right, and this induces right side bending. So if someone tells you that you can translate to the left, they're basically saying that you can side bend to the right. So that's how you translate. So going back to C2 and C7, side bending and rotation here are going to be different. They are going to rotate in the same direction. And how do you assess for this motion is the same, translation. So why is C1 written in red? It's a little bit different than the rest of them. Instead of trying to do translation, you're going to induce rotation. So what you're going to do is you're going to flex the spine to the level to 45 degrees, and then you are going to rotate the patient's head. This rotation is then going to tell you what direction you can and cannot rotate. And then using the same rule, you can tell that rotation and side bending occur in the opposite direction. So if they can rotate to the right, then they can side bend to the left. So let's go through a couple practice questions. So for this first one, in the exam they tell you that during flexion, the patient can side bend both directions normally. But during extension, the patient cannot side bend to the left. And let's say that these findings are for C4. So what's the diagnosis? So you follow the same rules. You always name it by what it can do. So looking back at the question, it can go into flexion normally, and it can side bend normally during flexion. So you can already say it's C4, flexed, something. You know it's going to be rotated and side bent to some direction. They tell you that during extension, you cannot side bend to the left. Remember, you always have to name a dysfunction by what it can do. So if it cannot side bend to the left, that means that it can side bend to the right. So can side bend to the right. And then following our rules for rotation and side bending, C4, side bending and rotation are in the same direction, so you're going to be C4 flexed, rotated right, side bent right. So for the next example, they tell you that during flexion you cannot translate to the left. This means that when they try and translate to the left, it doesn't want to go. But during extension, totally fine with translation. So translation is fine in both directions during extension. Let's say our findings are for C4, what's the diagnosis? Once again, same flow chart as always. You always name it by what it can do. So we're going to say C4 in extension translation is normal, so it's an extended dysfunction. You know it's going to be rotated and side bent in some direction. So they tell you that during flexion you cannot translate to the left. This means that you can translate to the right. But when you translate to the right, you have to remember that you are inducing left side bending. So it's a really important concept to understand which direction you're translation and what side bending direction that induces. So if you cannot translate to the left, that means that you can translate to the right, which means that you are inducing left side bending. So side bending to the left. And since it's C4, follow our chart, side bending and rotation are in the same direction. So our diagnosis is C4 extended, rotated left, side bent to the left. So now how do we treat this dysfunction? You can treat it many different ways, like we talked about in the previous lectures. You can do muscle energy, you can do HVLA, you can even do counterstrain if you want to. It's all up to what you're comfortable with, because there's no right answer for which one is better. So in this discussion, it'll be easier to give a demonstration on HVLA. So HVLA. So as we discussed previously, HVLA is a direct technique, meaning that we engage the restrictive barrier or we engage what the patient cannot do. And it's also passive. Passive means that the patient does not assist during treatment. They're totally relaxed. The practitioner does everything for the patient. There are some contraindications to HVLA, which you need to be looking out for in your patients and on the exam. If they give you one of these contraindications, HVLA is not the right answer. You need to pick a different treatment style. So what are the contraindications? So you have osteoporosis. You can have fractures and metastatic cancer. So just think about it this way. Osteoporosis, fractures and metastatic bone cancer can lead to a weakness in the vertebra. You don't want to be cracking weak vertebra, so don't do HVLA, you'll cause more damage than good. So what are some other contraindications? Rheumatoid arthritis and Down syndrome. So a contraindication to rheumatoid and Down is going to be the same thing. For both of these diagnoses, you have an unstable transverse ligament. Because of this instability, you are not able to perform and HVLA treatment technique because you'll cause harm. So if you see any of these, you are not allowed to treat the patient with HVLA. You have to pick something else. Easy way to remember this is that older individuals like Granny might have osteoporosis, fractures, cancer, maybe she's got rheumatoid. Don't be cracking Granny's neck. Choose something else. So there are two different types of HVLA treatments. You can have rotational HVLA, and you can have side bending HVLA. Both of these treatment styles are very similar in that they're direct and passive, but the setup is just slightly different, and I'll go through an example with the cervical spine. So let's say that you have a diagnosis of C5 FRS right. So I'm saying that's C5, can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. So how am I going to set this up for treatment? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the patient into the barrier, because it's a direct treatment. So put them into the position that they cannot do. So I'm going to induce slight extension. It's a rotational HVLA technique, so I'm going to set them into the rotational barrier first. So we're going to rotate to the left and then the last plane of motion is side bending. So I'm going to side bend to the left. The next part of the treatment is to get the patient to relax. You want them to take a couple deep breaths, get chilled out. It's easier to perform the HVLA technique when the patient is relaxed and they're not constricting their muscles anticipating an HVLA press. So wait until they're relaxed, instruct the patient to breathe. So the next step is one that they are totally relaxed, you can then induce your HVLA force. Because this is a rotational HVLA treatment, you're HVLA movement is going to be in rotation through the direct barrier. So you're going to HVLA, rotate left. So you're going to perform the rotary force through the barrier, which is to the left. After you perform the treatment, you are then going to passively return the patient to neutral and then you're going to rescreen. So remember, after any treatment, whether it's HVLA, muscle energy or whatever, you have to return the patient to neutral and you have to rescreen to see if your treatment worked. So now for side bending HVLA. Let's say once again our diagnosis is the same. So we'll say C5, FRS right. C5 can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. It's still a direct technique, so we're going to set him up into the barrier. So we're going to induce slight extension, it's a side bending treatment, so we're going to do side bending first into the barrier. So we're going to side bend to the left and this is where it's a little bit different for the cervical HVLA. Instead of rotating into the barrier, you're going to rotate into the freedom. So you're going to rotate right. The reason that you rotate right for this treatment is so that you can lock out the facets for everything above and below it for your treatment. So it really directs the treatment towards C5 and not anywhere else. So the important thing for you to see here is that rotation goes to the freedom for side bending, but it goes into the barrier for rotation. The rest of the steps are exactly the same. So you're going to have the patient relax. Once he's relaxed, you're going to do your HVLA force. Because it's a side bending HVLA treatment, you're going to induce your HVLA force through translation to the right. So this is where you have to remember, translating to the right means that you're inducing left side bending, and that is the barrier that you're going for, left side bending. So once you've done your HVLA thrusts, you then return the patient back to neutral and just like any other treatment, you always rescreen. So this is where we're going to break the lecture and stop talking about vertebra and we're going to start talking about a very important muscle that's located in the neck, the SCM, the sternocleidomastoid. So the SCM has two origins. It has a sternal head, which originates on the manubrium, so right at the top of the sternum. You have the clavicular head, which originates on the medial one-third of the clavicle. So the sternal head originates on the manubrium, the clavicular head originates on the medial one-third of the clavicle. The attachment is going to be the mastoid process. So now that you know where the SCM originates and where it attaches or inserts, you can now get an idea of what the SCM does when it contracts. So if your origin and insertion are here and you're contracting your muscle to bring the origin and the insertion closer together, you're inducing flexion, side bending towards, and rotating away. So as I'm making this motion, the origin and attachment are coming closer together. So what happens when the SCM is dysfunctional? Well, if you think about when the muscle is dysfunctional and it becomes hypertonic, it's going to shorten and it's going to try and stay very locked up in this position of what it can do. So if you know the anatomy, then you already know what happens during dysfunction. It does exactly what it does during normal motion, it just gets stuck that way. So the freedom for this dysfunction is going to be flexion, side bending towards and rotating away. The barrier of this dysfunction is going to be the opposite, or what it cannot do. So the barrier is extension, side bending away, rotating towards. Again, when the SCM is hypertonic, it wants to do this, it cannot do the opposite. So how do I do the treatment? So once again, this is going to be a recurring theme throughout the entire thing. You need to understand the concepts and then apply them to everything else. So if you're treating the SCM you can do it many ways. You can do muscle energy, engage the barrier, ask the patient to isometrically move into the freedom and keep them going. But for this discussion, we're going to talk about the counterstrain for this point. So we're going to do counterstrain to the SCM. Since the SCM has two origins, it can have two different treatments. We're going to talk about the main treatment position. This position is AC7. So the clavicular head insertion on the medial third of the clavicle is where AC7 is located. The sternal head is where AC8 is located. In this discussion, we're going to talk about AC7. So what's the treatment position? Remember, counterstrain is always fold and hold. And to do that, you bring the origin and insertion closer together. So you do what the muscle can do. So you already know what the treatment setup is. You know that the muscle can flex, side bend toward, rotate away. So for counterstrain for the SCM, you're going to flex, side bend toward, rotate away. So this lecture was broken up into two different segments. We talked about how you can diagnose the cervical vertebra and that there's no Fryette's laws in this area. You have to follow a different chart. We talked about how you induce translation and how it relates to side bending. We did some practice questions, gave some examples of HVLA, and definitely some contraindications, and then we switched gears, talked about the sternocleidomastoid and related it to counterstrain. And that's OMM for the cervical spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Cranial]  
﻿The topic of cranial is all about understanding the motion of two bones in relation to one another. It's usually difficult for students because there's a lot of 3D spatial awareness. But what I've done in this lecture is broken down these complex 3D motions into 2D structures that you can easily identify. So to first go over it, here's a picture of the two bones that we're talking about from a side view. Here's where the sphenoid is, here's the occiput, and here is the SBS joint, or the sphenobasilar synchondrosis. This joint is what we're going to be naming all the dysfunctions of. From a top down view, here is where the sphenoid is, here's where the occiput is, and here is that SBS joint. Remember, the SBS joint is the articulation between the sphenoid and the occiput where all motion rotates around. So to start off with, we're going to talk about how you can palpate these motions using the vault hold. The vault hold is going to tell you where you are going to hold your fingers in order to palpate the motion. Your index finger will be at the greater wing of the sphenoid. Your middle finger will be located on the temporal bone in front of the ear. Your ring finger will also be located on the temporal bone in the mastoid area, and your little finger will be on the squamous portion of the occiput. The main two points for you to get the diagnosis will be the index finger and the little finger. The index finger is palpating the motion of the sphenoid, and the little finger is palpating the motion of the occiput. So now I'm going to draw out the SBS joint where the sphenobasilar synchondrosis is and how the sphenoid and occiput relate to one another from three views - a view from the side, a view top down, and a view from the posterior view. So throughout all of these drawings, we're going to have the sphenoid in red and the occiput in blue. For a top down view, you're going to see this, where red is sphenoid, blue is occiput. And from a posterior to anterior view, you'll see this, where the two wings of the sphenoid are both level. So the two primary motions of the SBS are going to be flexion and extension. During flexion, the sphenoid and the occiput rotate outward. Now recall from the sacrum video, we had mentioned craniosacral motion, along with nutation and counternutation. When the SBS goes into flexion, the sacrum is going to move into counternutation. The sacrum will be pulled back posterior. The way you can think of this is as if there is a line that attaches the occiput to the top of the sacrum. So when the occiput rotates outward, it's going to tug the sacrum back up with it and dip it into counternutation. When you go into flexion, you are going to have a short AP axis, a wide transverse axis, and your sacrum will counternutate. The next motion is extension. Extension is the motion that's going to happen after flexion. Extension will bring the sphenoid and the occiput back to neutral. So it's going to look like this. So the occiput will rotate back down and the sphenoid will rotate back down. So the sphenoid and occiput are already in flexion. They're going to make this rotational movement to return back to neutral, and that movement is extension. When they make this movement, it's also going to move the sacrum. Now you still have that string that's on the sacrum. When the occiput rotates back down into neutral, the sacrum will then dip into nutation forward. So during extension, you're going to have a long AP axis, a narrow transverse axis, and your sacrum will nutate. So what about the rest of the cranial bones? During flexion, all other paired cranial bones will externally rotate. During extension, all paired cranial bones will internally rotate. This motion is what causes your short and long AP axis and your wide and narrow transverse axis. So now we're going to talk about dysfunctional motion and some different diagnoses that you can have in the world of cranial. So our first one is going to be a torsion. So here's what a drawing will look like from the posterior view. You have your occiput, and then you have your sphenoid. The motion that's occurring here is a twisting motion along an AP axis. Now the twisting motion is going to be different for the sphenoid and the occiput. Imagine that this hand is for the sphenoid and this one is for the occiput. While one hand rotates to the left, the other hand will rotate to the right. So this is the motion of a torsion from the posterior view. So here, the sphenoid is rotating to the left, while the occiput is rotating to the right. This motion occurs around an AP axis. And the motion is opposite of one another. So how do you name this dysfunction? You're going to name it based on which wing of the sphenoid is more superior. So in this drawing the right wing is more superior, so you have a right torsion. The second diagnosis that we're going to go over is a side bending and rotation. For this dysfunction, we're going to have the occiput and the sphenoid from a posterior view, except this time they both rotate in the same direction. So they both rotate to the left or they both rotate to the right along an AP axis. But there's also a second motion that happens. What happens here is there's rotation about two vertical axes, where they both rotate in opposite directions. So the sphenoid is rotating counterclockwise while the occiput is rotating clockwise. You're going to name this dysfunction based on which direction the sphenoid is rotating. So the sphenoid is rotating to the right, so this is a right side bending and rotation dysfunction. We discussed the rotation around the AP axis and they both rotate in the same direction. The rotation along the two vertical axes are in opposite directions. So there are three axes that side bending and rotation dysfunctions occur around. There's the AP axis where both bones rotate in the same direction, and then two vertical AP axes where they both rotate in the opposite direction. The next three dysfunctions are going to be something that you see in trauma patients. So the first one is going to be a shear. In this dysfunction, one bone is going to be rotated higher than the other. So the sphenoid will be rotating superiorly, while the occiput is rotating inferiorly. To name the dysfunction, you name which direction the sphenoid is rotating. So the sphenoid is rotating up, so this is an up shear or a superior shear. There are two axes that the bones rotate around, and they are both horizontal. So imagine the two axes are here and here, and both bones are rotating around the axes. Both bones are rotating in the same direction. In this example, they're both rotating counterclockwise. So in this example, you have an up shear or a vertical shear. The next dysfunction is lateral, and here you have the sphenoid and the occiput moving laterally in two different directions, the sphenoid moving right, the occiput moving left. You're going to name the dysfunction based on the direction the sphenoid is moving. The sphenoid is moving to the right, so we're going to name this right lateral. The final dysfunction that you may see is a compression dysfunction. In this dysfunction, both bones are coming together. So at the SBS, they're both compressing, so a compression dysfunction. So what are the indications that you're going to need to see in order to assess the patient for a cranial dysfunction? It can really be just about anything. So if the patient comes in and he's just saying, I don't feel so great, I'm tired, I have a headache, whatever, you can assess for cranial dysfunctions. If you're going to treat cranial, you're treatment pattern will be indirect. So remember, for indirect treatments, you push into the freedom or what they can do, or into the diagnosis. So if I want to treat a right torsion, I'm going to push the bones further into right torsion. So it's an indirect technique. The way that you're going to do this technique is with your fingers still in the vault hold and by moving into that motion. Two other techniques that you need to know the names of are CV4 and the V-spread. So a CV4 treatment is going to increase the patient's CRI, or cranial rhythmic impulse. A normal CRI is 8 to 12 per minute. If you want to increase the CRI, perform the CV4. V-spread is going to help you release sutures. When you release the sutures, you're going to have more motion at whatever suture you're treating. So we went over how to represent all of these dysfunctions pictorially, but what are you going to palpate when you're palpating the patient's cranium? So you have your fingers in the vault hold. You're going to have your pointers on the greater wing of the sphenoid and your little fingers on the squamous portion of the occiput. During flexion, you're going to feel both hands move towards the patient's feet while your fingers spread apart. So normal flexion will look like this, and this is what you'll palpate. Extension is going to bring you back to neutral. So once you're in flexion, extension will feel like this. Your fingers are going to come back where they started and your pointer and pinkie are going to be come closer together. So flexion and extension. What about torsion? When you're palpating a torsion, you always want to name based off whatever wing of the sphenoid is more superior. When you're doing this palpation, a torsion will feel like this motion. You're going to name it based on which wing of the sphenoid is more superior, and which finger is palpating that? Your pointer finger is. So if we're going to name a right torsion, the right pointer finger will be higher than the left. So right torsion, left torsion. What about side bending and rotation? Exaggerate the flexion and extension motions, just do them backwards. So one hand will go into flexion and the other hand will exaggerate into extension. Going the other direction, it will look like this, where one hand goes into the flexion motion and the other hand comes back and into exaggerated extension. You're going to name the dysfunction based on which hand goes further into flexion. So this will be a left side bending and rotation. Shears, you fingers will move in this direction. This will be an up shear. Up shear will move like this. A lateral strain is the parallelogram head that you remember from class. So you're going to feel this motion, where the fingers move into a parallelogram. You're going to name it based on which direction your pointer fingers are both going. So a right lateral shear, left lateral shear. So if you remember the hand motions, as well as the pictures that we've drawn, you should be really prepared for any cranial that comes up on your exams or even in the clinic. And that is OMM cranial. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Fibular Head and Foot Arches]  
﻿In this second and final video of the lower extremity, we're going to go over fibular head mechanics, the arches of the foot and some final counterstrain points of the lower extremity. In order to talk about the fibular head, we first have to talk about the motions of the foot. So we're going to start off there. So foot motions. Just like you can supinate and pronate your hand, you can also supinate and pronate your foot. So for pronation, if we want to do that with our foot we're going to have to go into dorsiflexion, eversion, AB duction, abduction. So what do those motions do? They take the foot a little bit further away from midline. So remember, dorsiflexion is when you bring your toes upward. Eversion is when you tilt your foot outward, away from the body, and abduction is when you take it further away. So that is going to be pronation. When you make that motion with your foot, other bony landmarks are also going to move to accommodate. So some motion is going to be in the talus and also in the tibia. When you pronate your foot, your talus and your tibia are going to accommodate by externally rotating. Your talus will also accommodate by moving posteriorly. So that's pronation. Let's move into supination. Remember, supination for your upper extremity is when you kind of turn your hand as if you're trying to hold a bowl of soup. It's the same idea for your feet as well, so imagine you're trying to hold a bowl of soup with your feet. For supination, it's going to be the opposite of pronation. So you're going to plantar flex, invert your foot and AD duct your foot, adduction. Remember that plantar flexion is when you point your toes down, inversion is when you tilt your foot inward, and AD duction is when you bring it closer to the midline. So if you do that with both of your feet, you might have a better chance holding a bowl of soup. When you do this, your talus and your tibia are going to accommodate this motion. It's going to be in the opposite direction. So talus and tibia will internally rotate and your talus will move anteriorly. So now that you understand the motions of the foot, we can now move into fibular head mechanics. Now the fibular head is going to be one of the main topics of this lecture, so you need to know the motions of the foot in order to understand the motions of the fibular head. So when you have your foot in neutral, the fibular head will also be in neutral. It'll be running parallel with the tibia. When you dorsiflex your foot, your fibular head is going to move. So when I dorsiflex, the fibular head will move anterior and the distal portion of the fibula will move posterior. So when you dorsiflex, you're going to have an anterior fibular head. It's going to be the opposite when you plantar flex. Your fibular head is going to go in the other direction. So when you plantar flex, the distal portion of your fibula will move anterior, and your fibular head will move posterior. So when you plantar flex, your fibular head will move posteriorly. P-P. So what are you going to see in a patient that has some sort of fibular head dysfunction? They'll potentially have some decreased range of motion in their ankle, which is because the fibular head is not moving properly. This lack of movement is going to cause a lack of accommodation for ankle motion into supination and pronation. What you can also see is pain in the ankle region, but also pain in the knee region. So if you have a patient who comes in with ankle pain and knee pain, you can potentially think of the fibula as being dysfunctional. Even if they come in with simply knee pain, you can still think of the fibula. So how do we make the diagnosis? You're going to do what's called the spring test. You're going to have the patient sitting on the edge of the examination table. You're going to pinch the fibular head bilaterally, and then you're going to spring the fibular head anteriorly and posteriorly. When you're doing this, you're going to assess for range of motion on both sides, and whichever side doesn't want to move furthest into one direction, then that's how you're going to know which side is dysfunctional and how to name it. Remember, you always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So if on the right side you're doing the spring test, it goes easily into the anterior motion but it doesn't really like to go posterior compared to the other side, that means you have a right anterior fibular head. So to get the diagnosis, you do the spring test. So how are we going to treat this dysfunction? We're going to use muscle energy. So remember back all the way at the beginning when we were talking about how you do muscle energy. You passively move the patient into the restrictive barrier, then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do, which is also the name of the diagnosis. So we're going to use that in order to set up the treatment. So let's say that we have an anterior fibular head first. So if you have an anterior fibular head, that means that the foot is more than likely in some sort of dorsiflexion. If it's in dorsiflexion, that means that your foot is pronated. So this is the freedom. This is what the foot can do. If you're going to put it into the barrier, that means you're going to put it into supination. So to achieve the barrier for this treatment, you put the foot into supination. So then what motion do we instruct the patient to move into for their isometric force? Move into the freedom. So what can they do? They can dorsiflex, because you have an anterior head dysfunction. So you put them into pronation. So you remember all the steps. You need to have them do this three times, move further into the barrier, then at the end bring them passively back to neutral and then you rescreen. It's going to be the exact opposite for the other dysfunction. So if you have a posterior fibular head, you're going to engage the restrictive barrier, posterior fibular head, plantar flexion, it likes to go into supination, the barrier is pronation. So pronation barrier and move into the freedom, which is the diagnosis, which is plantar flexion. Do the treatment, bring them passively back to neutral, rescreen. So now we're going to transition to a topic that still comes up on exams but is kind of more anatomy based. But we can talk about it in the OMM sense if you can think about manipulating where exactly the bones are by pushing them. So we're going to talk about the arches of the foot. Now we came up with an advanced organizer for this. It's going to be Tetris pieces. So you're going to see what I mean as I'm drawing this out. There are three different arches that we need to talk about, the transverse, the medial and the lateral. So I'll start out with transverse and we'll draw our Tetris piece. So in the Tetris piece we're going to have three bones: navicular, cuneiforms, and the cuboid. These three bones are going to make up your transverse arch. So the next two arches are your medial and lateral. So these two arches have the exact same Tetris piece as the transverse arch. So we'll start with that. Navicular, cuneiforms and the cuboid. So the transverse arch has the entire Tetris piece. It has the navicular, the cuneiforms and the cuboid. The medial and lateral arches share the Tetris piece. So the medial arch has a navicular and the cuneiforms, while the lateral arch has the cuboid. Because they share the Tetris piece, we're going to add in some extra bones. Each arch is going to get some of the metatarsals and one additional bone. So the medial arch is going to have metatarsals 1 through 3 and the talus, while the lateral arch is going to have metatarsals 4 through 5 and the calcaneus. So going over it again, transverse arch, the entire Tetris piece. Medial and lateral arches share the Tetris piece while they both have some extra metatarsals and one extra bone of the foot. So now we're going to finish the lecture with some counterstrain. But to talk about that, we're going to go over some of the ligaments of the ankle. So this is going to be your fibula, this is going to be your talus, and this will be your calcaneus. So imagine that the toes are this way, so we'll draw in some extra toes going this way. So there are three ligaments that we need to go over. We have the anterior talofibular, the calcaneofibular, and the posterior talofibular. So the name of the ligament gives away where it's located. Anterior talofibular is on the anterior side, connects the talus to the fibula. Posterior, same reason, and calcaneofibular exact same. The reason I point these out is so that you can know where the attachment and the origin of the ligaments are. So this is the final time that we have any counterstrain points. A moment of silence for counterstrain points. So counterstrain is an indirect technique. You bring the two ends closer together to make it do what it can do. So you're already going to beat me to this. How are we going to do counterstrain? So these ligaments are all on the lateral side of the foot. So if we're going to treat the lateral ankle and we need to bring the two ends closer together, we're going to evert the foot. Now imagine that we're on the medial side of the ankle. You have some different ligaments and different muscles that attach in that area as well. Don't worry about the names, but since they all attach in the same area, you're just going to bring the two ends together. And to do that, you're going to invert. And then one final one, plantar fascia. So a common thing that you'll see on the exams is an individual has lower foot pain when they wake up in the morning. It takes them a little while to stretch out. They can feel it right on the bottom of their foot or closer to their calcaneus. They're trying to point you toward plantar fasciitis. So how are you going to treat it with counterstrain? Bring the two ends closer together. So you're going to flex the foot and collapse it, and then add some compression to try and bring the two ends of the plantar fascia closer together. So for plantar fascia, you will flex and compress the foot. So this was our final lecture on lower extremity. We went over the motions of the foot and how to relate that to the fibular head mechanics. We went over the arches of the foot and used our Tetris piece example, and we also talked about the ankle, the ligaments and our final discussion on counterstrain. And that's lower extremity part two. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Forearm]  
﻿This is our third and final lecture of the upper extremity. In the first lecture, we went over dysfunctions of the shoulder area. In the second one we talked about the sits muscles, and in this lecture we're going to talk about the carrying angle, the radial head and some counterstrain points that you'll notice in the forearm. So we're going to start off with the carrying angle. So what is the carrying angle? Imagine that you're standing up straight and there is a heavy weight on the ground or a pail of water or backpack or whatever. When you pick up that weight, the angle that your arm is located is going to be the carrying angle. So to draw this out and how we calculate the carrying angle, we're going to have a few different axes of motion. So you have your humerus, your radius and your ulna. So there's two axes that you use to calculate the carrying angle. You're going to use a humoral axis, which runs directly down the shaft of the humerus, and then you are going to use the forearm axis, which is going to run between the radius and the ulna back towards the elbow. The carrying angle is going to be this angle here. In men, this angle is typically smaller than in women. In men, the typical angle is 5. In women, the typical angle is about 10. Usually you have plus or minus two degrees. So why are we talking about the carrying angle? So you can have two different types of carrying angle extremes. You can have cubitus valgus and you can have cubitus varus. So when we go over cubitus valgus first, imagine that someone is carrying a big weight, and instead of having their arm straight, their arm is going to look like a big L. Cubitus valgus. So their elbow is going to be close to their body and their wrist is going to be a little bit further out. So this is what we call cubitus valgus. So writing that out, cubitus valgus looks like a big L and it has an L in the name of it. This carrying angle is going to be greater than 15 degrees, and there are two landmarks that you need to know where they're located with this carrying angle. Imagine you have your arm in the shape of an L and you notice where your ulna and where your wrist are deviated. Your ulna is AB ducted, it's further away from your body, and your wrist is pointed towards you, so it's AD ducted, adducted. So they're both opposite. Your ulna is abducted, and your wrist is adducted. So writing this out, you have an abducted ulna and an adducted wrist. So the first type of carrying angle extreme that you can have is cubitus valgus. So what's cubitus varus? It's going to be the opposite. So instead of having a bit L angle, you're going to be kind of cattywonkus like this, where your elbow is further out and your wrist is really close to your body. The main difference that you need to see here is that your ulna is now AD ducted, it's closer to you, it's adducted, and your wrist is now pointed away from your body, so it's abducted, AB ducted. So writing that whole thing out, we have cubitus varus. The carrying angle that you're looking for is less than 3 degrees. You're going to have an AD ducted ulna and an AB ducted wrist. Don't worry about being able to fix the angle right now. Really, you're going to be asked to diagnose the carrying angle and understand where the landmarks are for each diagnosis. So we're going to leave the carrying angle behind and we're going to start talking about the radial head. So the radial head is the head of the radial bone. So it moves when you are supinating and pronating your arm. When your arm goes into supination, your radial head goes anteriorly. When you pronate, your radial head goes posteriorly. So writing that out, pronate equals posterior, and supinate goes anterior. So remember, we always name a dysfunction based on what it can do. So when we go through these examples, think about where the radial head likes to go during motion. So imagine that you fall forward onto an outstretched hand. When you fall forward, you're going to pronate your hand to catch yourself. And when you pronate your hand, your radial head is already posterior. Well, imagine when you do that motion, you're then going to jam your radial head where it currently is. So it's going to get stuck posterior, so you're going to have a posterior radial head dysfunction. So writing out the example, fall forward, pronated catch and a posterior dysfunction. So what about an anterior radial head? It's going to be the exact opposite. Imagine you fall backward. You're still going to try and catch yourself with your hand, but your hand is going to be supinated. When you supinate your hand, your radial head is anterior and it's going to jam it further anterior. That's where it likes to go, that's the name of the diagnosis. So writing it out, fall backward, supinated catch, anterior dysfunction. So how do we make this diagnosis in a patient? What we're going to do is we're going to have the patient seated. We're going to have both of his arms flex at 90 degrees, and then we're going to passively assess pronation and supination. Passively pronate, then passively supinate. We're going to measure which one doesn't want to go in a certain direction in order to make our diagnosis. But remember, name the diagnosis on what it can do. So to make the diagnosis, you're going to passively move. So how are we going to treat these dysfunctions? We're going to use muscle energy for this, and the reason is it's easy to set up a barrier and it's easy to give an isometric contraction. Both treatments are very similar to one another, but the barrier that you engage and the isometric force direction are going to be opposite to one another. So remember, all the way back at the beginning when we talked about what does muscle energy mean? You passively engage the barrier. You ask the patient to then move into the freedom of what they can do, move further into the restrictive barrier and so on and so forth. Same concept, different barriers. So for a posterior dysfunction, what's the barrier going to be? It's what they cannot do. If it's a posterior dysfunction, they cannot supinate. So the barrier that you're going to engage is a supination barrier. Now in what direction are you going to ask the patient to isometrically move? What they can do, into the freedom. So they can pronate. So if it's a posterior dysfunction, your barrier is supination, your isometric force is into pronation. It's going to be backwards for supination. So if it's a supinated dysfunction, the barrier that you're going to engage is pronation, and the isometric force direction into the freedom will be supination. After your treatment, make sure that you bring the patient back to neutral and rescreen. So this is all for the treatment. Diagnosis, barrier, freedom. Diagnosis, barrier, freedom. So to finish out upper extremity, we're going to go over some common counterstrain points that you're going to see. And there are three big ones that we're going to go over. The first one is going to be the long head of the bicep. I bet I know what you're thinking. I already know how to do the treatment. I put them into the passive position, the position of ease. I bring the muscle ends together. Exactly right. So to do this treatment, we're going to have the patient flex, AB duct and internally rotate. These three motions together bring the attachment and origin closer together for your treatment. The next position that we're going to talk about is medial epicondylitis. So medial epicondylitis is located on your medial epicondyle. All the muscles that attach to this are your forearm flexors. This is also known as golfer's elbow. So if all the forearm flexors attach to that location, what do you think the counterstrain position is going to be? Flexion. You're going to shorten the muscles. So you're going to flex the forearm, pronate and AD duction. The final one that we're going to talk about is the opposite of medial epicondylitis. It's lateral epicondylitis. It is called tennis elbow. The way that you can think about this is all the extensors of the forearm attach to that spot. Your treatment setup is going to be the exact opposite of the flexors. So just extend everything. So we have lateral epicondylitis, and you're just going to do everything backwards. So you're going to extend, supinate and AB duct. So we went over the treatment positions, but make sure that you don't forget the exact steps that you have to follow for counterstrain. You find the tender point, you make it a ten out of ten on the pain scale, passively move them into the position. Make sure it's less than three on the pain scale. Hold for 90 seconds, passively return to neutral and rescreen. You got to know all of the positions but you also have to remember the steps. So in this lecture, we went over three broad topics. We went over the carrying angle, how to calculate the angle and the two different diagnoses you can have. We went over radial head, pronation and supination, and some common falls that you're going to be asked about along with the treatment positions. And finally wrapped up with some counterstrain. And that's OMM for the forearm. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Hip Area and Knee v3]  
﻿Now we're going to begin our discussion on the lower extremity. We've divided this lesson into two different sections. This first section is going to go over Spencer technique for the hip, the important muscle piriformis, the ligaments of the knee and everyone's favorite counterstrain. So, we're going to start off with Spencer technique for the hip. So just like the Spencer technique for the shoulder, there's going to be different barriers that you need to engage during different portions of your treatment. So, the mnemonic to remember these barriers is Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin. Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin. These are going to be the barriers that you need to engage during treatment by moving the lower extremity. So, what are these barriers? Flexion, extension, compression with circumduction, traction with circumduction, internal rotation, external rotation, abduction and adduction. So, remember to engage these barriers you're going to move the lower extremity into these barriers. If it helps you remember, each two steps are opposite of one another. So, flexion extension, compression traction, internal external rotation, abduction adduction. B comes before D an alphabet, so abduction first. So next we're going to talk about the piriformis. You're going to see this muscle a lot in the clinic, but also on your practice questions. So, we're going to make sure to spend some time talking about it here. So, the origin of the piriformis is the posterior side of the sacrum. The insertion is the greater tubercle of the femur. So, knowing the origin and insertion and how muscles work, you have an idea of how that muscle is going to affect the body. So, when the muscle contracts, it brings the origin and insertion closer together knowing where these two are [indiscernible] those anything will make, external rotation of the lower extremity. So, function is lower extremity external rotation. So, what about when it's dysfunctional? Remember a dysfunctional muscle is just going to stay hypertonic. It's going to stay contracted which will pull the origin and insertion closer together and keep them there. So, you already know that position. It's going to be lower extremity external rotation. So, in dysfunctional you're going to see a patient that has lower extremity external rotation. Now here's a clinical correlate that will definitely come up. Remember from anatomy the sciatic nerve comes out just below the piriformis muscle. So, when the muscle is dysfunctional and becomes hypertonic, it can start to impend into sciatic nerve leading to shooting burning pains down the patient's leg. The patient presents like that in your clinic or if you happen to see that on some practice questions, they may be trying to get you to think about the piriformis. So, to help you remember that, I'm going to put sciatic nerve. So, how are we going to treat the piriformis? There're many ways to treat all the muscles in the body as long as you remember the core concepts from the treatment modality lesson. So here we're going to discuss how to treat the piriformis using muscle energy. Now muscle energy if you remember back, how do you perform it? You put the patient into the barrier of what they can't do. You have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do repeat three to five times, back to neutral, rescreen. So, for muscle energy you need to engage the barrier. Now the barrier for the piriformis is what it can't do. So, when it's dysfunctional external rotation, so what it can't do is internal rotation. So internal rotation is the barrier. Then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom or what they can do, and you already know what they can do, they can externally rotate. So lower extremity external rotation is the freedom. So now we're going to leave the piriformis and start talking about the ligaments of the knee. So, here's your femur. Here's your tibia and here's your fibula. Now this isn't an anatomy course. Don't get too bogged down trying to think of the exact origin and insertion, just get an idea of where these ligaments are, what side of the knee the patient may have pain and where you would palpate the structures? So, on the patient's medial side they're going to have the MCL or the Medial Collateral Ligament and the medial meniscus. So, when you palpate it on the medial side, it'll be on the medial side. So medial is the MCL and medial meniscus and what about the lateral side? On the lateral side you're going to palpate the LCL and the lateral meniscus. So lateral LCL and lateral meniscus. Now you have the ACL and the PCL. You can't palpate the structures from the anterior side because of the patella, so both of these structures will be palpable from the posterior side. So, the ACL attaches to the anterior portion of the tibia and the posterior portion of the femur and you'll feel it from the posterior side. The PCL attaches to the posterior side of the tibia and the anterior side of the femur. You'll still feel it from the posterior side. So now that you have a general idea of where on the knee these structures are and where the patient may have a tender point, we're going to talk about everyone's favorite counterstrain. Now I think at this part in the lecture series, we've been counterstrain to death, fold and hold treatment, bring the origin and insertion closer together, hold for 90 seconds, go through all those steps. So, this should be pretty easy for you. Now that you know where the structures are on the knee. So, if you have an MCL or medial meniscus tender point on the medial side of the knee you'll treat it with flexion adduction, an internal rotation. So, you're going to flex the patient's knee, adduct the tibia and bring it closer to the body and then you're going to internally rotate the tibia. All these motions will bring both ends of the MCL closer together for your counterstrain treatment position and we're going to compare that to the LCL and the lateral meniscus. You're going to feel this tender point on the lateral side and because it's on the opposite side of the MCL, the treatment position will be the opposite. So flexion abduction and external rotation. So, you're going to once again flex at the knee, abduct the tibia, which will abduct the fibula bringing both ends of the LCL closer together and you will add external rotation of the lower extremity to get them even closer. So next you have the ACL and the PCL. Now to treat these two with counterstrain, you're going to have to use the third osteopathic arm, which is basically anything that you have in the office to help you during treatment setup. This could be a pillow, a bunch of T-shirts, the foundation's textbook whatever you have on hand. So, to treat the ACL we're going to use a third osteopathic arm of a pillow and we're going to place it behind the femur, then we're going to push the tibia posterior. So now we're going to draw a picture so you can get an idea of how this treatment position would work. So, here's the femur from the lateral side, here's the tibia from the lateral side and here's the patella on the anterior portion of the knee. You have the ACL running from the anterior portion of the tibia to the posterior femur and you have the PCL posterior tibia going to the anterior femur. So, if you place a pillow behind the femur and then you push the tibia posteriorly, you're going to bring the two ends of the ACL closer together. That's going to be your counterstrain treatment position for the ACL. So, the PCL attaches in the opposite places of the ACL. So, what do you think the treatment position will be? The opposite. So, you're going to put the pillow behind the tibia and you're going to push the femur posterior. So, your pillow is going to go behind the tibia, you're going to push the femur posteriorly, that's going to bring both edges closer together, that's your counterstrain treatment point. So, the next two muscles we're going to compare together are the piriformis and the glutes. So, we already discussed the piriformis, the origin and insertion and what the muscle typically does, which is lower extremity external rotation. We talked about how to treat with muscle energy, but you can also treat it with counterstrain. The treatment position is going to be the position of these for the muscle, which as you'll recall will be external rotation. If you need to get the pain scale below 3 out of 10, you can add in slight abduction and slight flexion. So, comparing that to the glutes. The glutes are the primary hip extensors of your body. So, the position of ease of the glutes is going to be hip extension, countering treatment position, hip extension and if you need to readjust to get the pain below 3 out of 10, you can add abduction and you can also add external rotation. So, the final two we're going to have the PSOAS and the Iliacus. Now remember we already went over so PSOAS back in the lumbar lesson. So, if you recall this is the one where the tender point is two-thirds the distance between the ASIS and umbilicus. So, two-thirds, ASIS and umbilicus. So, what was the primary motion of the PSOAS? It was flexion, external rotation and slight side bending towards, so what do you think the counterstrain position will be? What the muscle can do? So, flexion, external rotation and side bending towards. Now the iliacus is pretty similar to the PSOAS in terms of function and where the tender point will be. The iliacus tender point is one-third the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus. So, one-third ASIS and umbilicus. Since the muscle movement is also pretty similar compared to the PSOAS the treatment position will also be pretty similar. So, it will be flexion, external rotation and instead of side bending towards, we're going to add abduction of the lower extremity. So, we went over a lot in this lesson. We talked about the Spencer technique for the hip and the mnemonic Felines Eating Catnip Trip Into Everything Around Austin to help you remember the barriers. The important muscle piriformis along with the sciatic nerve clinical correlate. The locations of all of the ligaments of the knee and where you would be able to palpate the structures as well as where the patient may have pain and we brought a lot back home were some counterstrain and that's OMM for the lower extremity part 1. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Hip Area and Knee]  
﻿Now we're going to talk about OMM for the lower extremity. This series is just going to be split into two videos. This first video, we're going to go over the Spencer technique for the hip, the important muscle piriformis, the ligaments of the knee, and of course, some counterstrain points. So we're going to start off with Spencer for the hip. So just like the Spencer technique for the shoulder, you're going to have multiple steps for the Spencer technique of the hip. So in order to memorize this, come up with another pneumonic that we can use. Felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So remember, felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So these letters represent the barriers that we are going to place the patient into for treatment. So the first one is flexion barrier, then you have extension, then you have compression with circumduction, then you have traction with circumduction, then you have internal rotation, external rotation, AB duction, and then AD duction. All of these motions that you can do with the lower extremity flexed in order to get the motion correct. Another way to look at this is if you notice, every two barriers are opposite of one another. Flexion extension, compression traction, internal external, AB duct AD duct. So remember, felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin. So now we're going to talk about the piriformis. This muscle comes up on just about every single OMM exam that I've ever taken. So we're going to spend some time to talk about it. So the piriformis origin is on the posterior side of the sacrum. The insertion is on the greater tubercle of the femur. So if we think about concepts in anatomy, what do you think the piriformis is going to do? It attaches on the sacrum, inserts at the greater trochanter. So if we think about the origin and insertion, we can get an idea of the motion that the piriformis does. When the muscle contracts, it brings both ends closer together, and to do that the lower extremity must externally rotate. So the piriformis causes lower extremity external rotation. So function is lower extremity external rotation. So what about when it's dysfunctional? So think about this. When the piriformis is dysfunctional, it's going to be hypertonic. It's going to be contracted and stuck in that position. So it's going to keep both ends of the muscle closer together. What does that mean? It means that the leg is externally rotated. So when it's dysfunctional, you're going to see an external rotation of the lower extremity. Now here's a clinical correlate that always pops up on exams. You have to remember anatomically that the sciatic nerve comes out right below the piriformis. If the piriformis is dysfunctional and hypertonic, it can begin to compress the sciatic nerve. And when that happens, the patient will have lower extremity paresthesias, potentially some burning and shooting pain. So if you see something like that in a clinic or on an exam, they might be trying to tell you to take a look at the piriformis and see if it's dysfunctional. So to keep that in your head I'm going to put sciatic nerve. So how are we going to treat this? There's a couple different ways to treat the piriformis, but the first one that we're going to go over is muscle energy. So thinking back to the beginning about how you do muscle energy, you put the muscle into the restrictive barrier where it cannot go. You have the patient flex into the freedom or where it can go. You do that multiple times, bring them back to neutral, rescreen. So the thing that you need to know for the piriformis is, where is the restrictive barrier and what motion do they need to do to go into the freedom? We already wrote it down. When it's dysfunctional, it can externally rotate. So what we're going to do to engage the barrier for muscle energy treatment is to internally rotate. So then what motion are we going to have the patient do isometrically in order to move into the freedom? We get them to do what the muscle can do, which is external rotation. So when treating with muscle energy, you always engage the restrictive barrier passively and then you have the patient isometrically contract into the freedom. Once that the treatment's over, you're going to bring the patient back to neutral and rescreen. So we're going to leave piriformis behind and we're going to begin to talk about some of the ligaments of the knee. And to do that, we're going to draw a picture. So this is going to be your femur, and this is going to represent your tibia. Your fibula will be on this side to show you that this is lateral and this is medial. So there are four big structures that we need to talk about that are located in the knee. The first structures are on the medial side of the knee, and that's going to be your MCL, your medial collateral ligament, and your medial meniscus. So they're going to be located medial meniscus, MCL. Don't worry about getting into the nitty gritty of what they attach to, where they are, what the function is. That's for your anatomy course. Just understand that they're located on the medial side of the knee and they help with knee stability. So next, the lateral side of the knee, we're going to see the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus. So it's just going to be on the opposite side. So you have the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus. Two more ligaments, and both are going to be noticed from the posterior side. You have the anterior collateral ligament, which attaches to the anterior side of the tibia and the posterior side of the femur. You also have the posterior collateral ligament. The posterior collateral ligament attaches to the posterior side of the tibia and the anterior side of the femur. The reasons that we're going over these ligaments is so that you can get an idea of some counterstrain treatments of these ligaments. So if the patient is having pain in their medial knee and you find a tender point there, you'll probably want to treat the MCL. Lateral side, you're going to think about the LCL, and if you're palpating on the posterior side of the knee, you're going to have to think about the ACL and the PCL. So we're going to go ahead and discuss what the counterstrain positions are for these ligaments and some other important muscles of the lower extremity. So counterstrain. You already know how to do this treatment. I think that we've beaten it to death. It's indirect. You bring the two ends of the muscle closer together. You fold and hold. It's that simple. So if you have a tender point located on the medial side of the knee, you need to think about the MCL and the medial meniscus. If you're going to bring the two ends of the MCL together, you're going to flex, AD duct and internally rotate. So you're going to flex the knee joint, you're going to AD duct the tibia, so bring it closer to the body, which will then bring the tibia closer to the femur on the medial side, and then you will internally rotate the tibia. That's going to bring the two ends of the MCL closer together for your treatment position. We're going to compare that to the LCL and the lateral meniscus. They're located on the lateral side of the knee, so you're going to have to do the opposite that you would for the MCL. You're still going to flex, but you're going to AB duct and externally rotate. So you're going to flex the knee joint, AB duct the tibia away from the body, which will bring it closer to the femur on the lateral side, and then you're going to externally rotate the tibia to bring the two ends of the LCL closer together. So now we're going to compare those to the posterior tender points. On the posterior side, you'll have the ACL and the PCL. So for these two treatments, we're going to have to bring a friend to the party. We're going to have to use what we call the third osteopathic arm. Basically, whatever you have laying around to help you with the treatment. So in this one, we're going to use a pillow as an example. So for the ACL, you need to bring this anterior attachment on the tibia and the posterior attachment on the femur closer together. And the way that you're going to do that is place a pillow on the posterior side of the femur and then posteriorly push the tibia. So imagine this. You have the patient laying on their back. You have a pillow underneath the femur and you are pushing down on the tibia towards the table. That's going to push the tibia posteriorly, which is going to push this attachment closer to the attachment on the femur. The PCL treatment position is the opposite. So we're going to place the pillow under the tibia and we are going to push posteriorly on the femur. This motion will then bring both ends of the PCL closer together. So the next two that we're going to compare, we're going to talk about the piriformis and the glutes. So we already talked about one way to treat the piriformis, which could be muscle energy. If you find a tender point and you want to treat it with counterstrain, you just have to put it into the position of ease or what it can do, which we already discussed. The piriformis externally rotates, so you're going to externally rotate the lower extremity to do the counterstrain position. So for piriformis, your primary motion is going to be externally rotating. If you need to adjust slightly to make sure that you get below three on the pain scale, you can add slight AB duction and slight flexion. What about the glutes? So the glutes are primarily extensors of the hip and the lower extremity. So if you're going to put it into the treatment position that it usually goes in when it's contracted, it's extension. So the treatment position is going to be extension. The rest of the position, if you need to adjust to make sure that you get below three on that pain scale, is the exact same as the piriformis. Externally rotate and AB duction. Primary motion, extension. So two more counterstrain points that we're going to go over. The first one is going to be the psoas muscle, and the second one is going to be iliacus. Now if you remember, we already went over the psoas muscle earlier in the video series. This point is located two-thirds of the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus. It's primarily a hip flexor and it causes side bending towards the dysfunctional side. So what do you think the treatment position is to bring both ends together? Flexion and side bending towards. So just as a reminder, the psoas counterstrain point is two-thirds the distance between the ASIS and the umbilicus, and the treatment position is going to be flexion, external rotation and side bending towards the dysfunction. So we're going to compare that to iliacus. The tender point for iliacus is going to be located one-third the distance from the ASIS to the umbilicus. The motion of the iliacus is very similar to that of the psoas. So the treatment position is going to be very similar to the psoas as well. So for this, we're going to remember that it's one-third the distance from the ASIS to the umbilicus, and the treatment position is going to include flexion, external rotation and instead of side bending towards, you're going to AB duct the lower extremity from the side of dysfunction. So in this lecture we went over a lot. We went over the Spencer technique for the hip and the pneumonic "felines eating catnip trip into everything around Austin." We went over the always important piriformis muscle, some of the major structures of the knee, and we related that to how to use it, counterstrain points, talked about counterstrain points for piriformis and glutes, psoas and iliacus. That's OMM for the lower extremity, part one. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Innominate Dysfunctions v2]  
﻿Being able to diagnose the innominates should be pretty easy when compared to being able to diagnose the sacrum. You're still going to have to do an exam to figure out the laterality of the dysfunction and you still need to palpate some landmarks but being able to visualize emotions are going to be significantly easier than the sacrum. So, to start off, you have to figure out the laterality of the dysfunction. The way that you do that is by performing the standing flexion test. So, this test is exactly the same as a seated flexion test for the sacrum except instead of having the patient seated, you're going to have the patient standing. So you're going to have the patient stand, hook both of your thumbs underneath the patient's PSIS and as they flex forward, you're going to assess which thumb moves first, farthest or fastest, whichever thumb does that that's the side of the dysfunction and that's what you're going to name the dysfunction based off. So, there are two different tests that you can do for laterality. You can either do the standing flexion test or you can do the ASIS compression test. Now I put or because you don't have to do both exams. You only have to do one. You can choose whichever one you would like to do, but on a practice question, they may only give you the findings for the compression test and you'll need to know that means the same thing as a standing flexion test. The way to do this test, you have the patient lying supine on the table, you're going to place both of your hands on the patient innominates and you're going to push posteriorly, whichever side doesn't move easy or whichever side gives you a hardened feel is a side of the dysfunction. So, if it's dysfunctional on the right, it's going to be very difficult to compress down. So, once you figure out the laterality, you need to palpate some landmarks. The landmarks that you need to palpate are going to be the ASIS, the PSIS and the pubic tubercle. So, the ASIS is the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine. That's the bony landmark on the anterior surface of the innominates. The PSIS is the Posterior Superior Iliac Spine located on the posterior side of the Innominate. The PT is the Pubic Tubercle, you're going to palpate that on the anterior side of the abdomen going down low near the pubic area. So, when you palpate these findings, it's going to give you an idea of motion that the innominates are performing. The ASIS findings can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. Your PSIS findings can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. And your pubic tubercle findings can either be superior, or inferior. So superior or inferior to what? You're going to be comparing these landmarks bilaterally to one another. So, you're going to be comparing the right ASIS to the left ASIS. For example, if the right ASIS is superior, that means it's higher up than the left ASIS. Now there are three different dysfunctions that you can have for the innominates. You can either have a rotation, a shear, or you can have a flare. So, the first type of dysfunction is a rotation. These are really simple to visualize. Imagine that you are palpating the patient's sacrum and you're looking from the posterior side a rotation is simply the innominate rotating. It can either be an anterior rotation, where it goes forward or it can be a posterior rotation, where it goes backward. So, innominate anterior-posterior rotation. So, what are your landmark findings going to be for these diagnoses? We're going to look at the ASIS, the PSIS, we are also going to take a look at leg length, the cause and some treatments. So, for an anterior rotation, your ASIS will be inferior on the side of the dysfunction, your PSIS will be superior on the side of the dysfunction and that will be an anterior rotation. Now when you anteriorly rotate the inanimate, it's going to push the rest of the anatomy downward thus creating a long leg for the patient. So, if the patient has an anterior rotation, they may have a long leg on presentation. So, what's one cause of an anterior innominate rotation? Hypertonic muscles, so the muscle that attaches to the anterior portion of the innominates is your quads. When your quads become hypertonic, it can pull the anterior portion of the pelvis forward thus creating an anterior rotation. So, if you have dysfunctional quads, you may have an anterior rotation. Now the way that you're going to treat this if you want to target a muscle for muscle energy, you're going to work on a muscle that attaches to the posterior side to help pull the innominate back in a neutral. That muscle is going to be your hamstrings. So, if you want to treat an interior rotation with muscle energy, you'll target the hamstrings. Now a posterior rotation is basically the exact opposite of an anterior. So, the ASIS on the side of the dysfunction will be superior. The PSIS on the side of the dysfunction will be inferior. With a posterior rotation the anatomy will be pulled upward thus creating a short leg and it's going to be the opposite cause and treatment muscles for the rotation. So, one muscle that will cause a posterior rotation is the hamstrings and one muscle that you can use to treat a posterior rotation is the quads. So, the next dysfunctions are going to be the shear dysfunctions. You can have an up-shear, a down-sheer, a pubic up-shear and a pubic down-shear. The landmarks that you're going to be palpating are the ASIS, PSIS, the pubic tubercle and we're going to mention the leg length again. So, what's an up-shear and a down-shear? If you're holding the patient's innominates, an up-shear is just going up up-shear down-shear down, that's it. So, your landmark findings for an up-shear everything's going to be up. So, you're going to have a superior ASIS on the side of the dysfunction, superior PSIS and a superior pubic tubercle. Now imagine if you have an up-shear it's going to pull all the anatomy upward that's going to cause a short leg on the side of the dysfunction, so short. Down-shear going down is going to be the opposite. So, your findings will be the opposite. ASIS on the side of the dysfunction will be down, PSIS will be down and the pubic tubercle will also be down. If you're pushing the anatomy downward for a shear, the anatomy will go down and you'll have a long leg. So, what about a pubic up-shear and down-shear? It's little bit interesting for these the only finding that you're going to have is on the pubic tubercle. So, you're not going to have any dysfunctional locations for ASIS or PSIS, but your pubic tubercle will be superior on a pubic up-shear. On a pubic down-shear, no ASIS or PSIS findings, but your pubic tubercle will be inferior on the side of the dysfunction. So, the final type of dysfunction for the innominates are flares. You can either have an in-flare or an out-flare. Now an in-flare or an out-flare basically means that the innominate is curled inward or outward. So, an in-flare looking from the top down, the ASIS will curl medially. For an out-flare the ASIS will curl laterally. So, your landmark findings will be your ASIS and your PSIS. For an in-flare it's going to be medial for the ASIS and the PSIS you'll either have no findings or will be lateral. For an out-flare your ASIS will be lateral and your PSIS will either have no findings or will be medial. So, let's go over some practice questions to really hammer this back home. So, for the first one, you're going to have a positive standing flexion test on the right, an ASIS inferior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. So, you have two options. You can either have a memory of all of the different findings or you can use the cowabunga hands. cowabunga hand is just a visual representation of the inanimate motion, where your thumbs will represent your PSIS findings and your pinkies will be the ASIS findings. So, your findings are a right standing flexion test being positive, the right ASIS being inferior on the right side and to show that you can rotate your hand forward. This also has your PSIS being superior on the right, which is also a finding. So now that you're in this motion, you can really easily tell that you have a right anterior rotation, which is your diagnosis. So right anterior rotation. So, question 2. You have a compression test that's positive on the left, an ASIS that's inferior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. Now remember, you need to have the landmark findings on the side of the dysfunction. So, when you're doing the cowabunga hands or your writing it out, you need to make sure that you can flip your findings to the other side. For example, if the right ASIS is superior, that's the same thing as saying that the left ASIS is inferior. So, when you're doing the cowabunga hands for this question, the compression test being positive on the left tells you that the left side is dysfunctional. The right ASIS is inferior. So, you can rotate your right hand to show this and you're right PSIS is superior, because you need to know the findings of the dysfunctional side, which is the left side, you need to rotate your right hand back to neutral and rotate your left hand the same amount. This will now show that the findings on the right side are in neutral and the left side is dysfunctional. This now shows you that you have a left posterior innominate rotation, which is the correct answer. So left posterior rotation. So, question 3. You have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right. An ASIS that's superior on the right and a PSIS that's also superior on the right. So cowabunga hands, right hand dysfunctional, right ASIS and PSIS are both superior. So, this shows you that you have a right up- shear. So right up-shear. Next question, you have a positive compression test on the left. An ASIS that's superior on the right and a PSIS that's superior on the right. cowabunga hands, right ASIS and PSIS are both superior, but the dysfunctions on the left side because of the left compression test being positive. So, this will easily show you that you have a left down-shear, because the left side is now down. So, you have a left down-shear. Question 5, you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right and an ASIS that is medial on the right. PSIS you have no findings. So cowabunga hands, right ASIS is now more medial and this will show you a right in-flare, you're curling inward. So, you have a right in-flare and for the final question, you have a compression test that's positive on the left. You have an ASIS that's equal on both sides, PSIS that's equal on both sides and a pubic tubercle that's superior on the right and you can't really use the cowabunga hands for a pubic shear, but these are pretty easy to find out. ASIS and PSIS you have no findings. So pubic tubercle is going to be what you base the diagnosis on. Pubic tubercle is superior on the right, but the compression test is positive on the left. So, the left side is dysfunctional, because the right side is higher, that means that the left side is lower, which means that you have a left pubic down-shear. So, we went over how to diagnose the innominates in this lecture. The first step is to either perform the standing flexion test or ASIS compression test to find which side is dysfunctional, you need to palpate your landmarks, you need to figure out if it's a rotation, shear or flare dysfunction and we went over some practice questions to make sure that you got it and that's OMM for the innominates. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Innominate Dysfunctions]  
﻿Being able to diagnose the innominates is pretty simple when you compare it to being able to diagnose the sacrum. You only need to know where the landmarks are in relation to one another to get the question correct. In this lecture, I'm going to walk you through how to get the correct diagnosis based on where the landmarks are. We're going to use a simple hand gesture to get the correct diagnosis. Then at the very end I'm going to include a flow chart for people that like flow charts. So if you take a look at the picture, on the anterior side of the innominate you have the anterior superior iliac spine or the ASIS. On the posterior side of the innominate, you have the posterior superior iliac spine, or the PSIS. Back on the anterior portion of the innominate, you have the public tubercle. You're going to use these three landmarks in order to get your innominate diagnosis. So we're going to use those landmarks to get the correct diagnosis for the innominates. So the first thing that you need is the standing flexion test. Now the standing flexion test is basically the same test as the seated flexion test, except instead of having the patient seated, they're going to be standing up. So don't get confused between the seated flexion test and the standing flexion test. The seated flexion test is only for the sacrum. The standing flexion test is for the innominates. So what we're going to do is have the patient standing. We're going to hook our thumbs below the PSIS and have the patient bend forward into flexion. As they go into flexion, one of our thumbs is either going to move first, furthest or fastest. Whichever side does that is going to be your positive side. That's going to be the side of dysfunction, and that's what you're going to name the diagnosis from. A test that's similar to the standing flexion test is called the ASIS compression test. This test tells you the same thing as the standing flexion test. It just says which side is positive. The way you perform this test is you have the patient laying on their back, supine, and you take both hands and you push posteriorly on the ASIS. Whichever side is more mobile is going to be the positive side, the positive compression test. You can compress it more. So then back to landmark anatomy for what you need to make the diagnosis. You have the ASIS, and there are four different findings that you can have for the ASIS. It can either be superior, it can be inferior, or it can be medial or lateral. All of these findings are in relation to the ASIS on the other innominate bone. So if the ASIS on the right side is superior, that means that the ASIS on the left side is inferior. Now the next landmark is the PSIS, and you can have the exact same findings for that. It can either be superior, inferior, medial or lateral. So these are once again in relation to the other innominate PSIS. So if the PSIS on the left is inferior, that means that the PSIS on the right is superior. The last landmark that you have is the pubic tubercle. The pubic tubercle can either be superior or inferior in relation to the other. So if one is inferior, the other is superior. So there are three different types of dysfunctions that you can have for the innominates. You can have rotations, shears and flares. So we're going to go over rotations first. The rotational dysfunction means that one of the innominates is rotated further than the other. You can either have an anterior rotation, meaning that it tips interiorly, or you can have a posterior rotation, meaning that it tips posteriorly in relation to the other. So if you have an anterior rotation, you're going to have these landmark findings. Your ASIS is going to be inferior on the side of the standing flexion test. Your PSIS is going to be superior on the side of the standing flexion test. When you have an anterior rotation, you are also going to have a longer leg on that side. So think about this anatomically. If the innominate is rotated anteriorly, you are pushing the rest of the bones downward, so you're creating a long leg. So what's one item that can cause this dysfunction? You can have hypertonic quads. So think about the anatomically. Your quads are on the anterior portion of your thigh. They attach to the anterior portion of your innominate. If they're hypertonic, they're going to yank down the rest of the innominate, causing a forward bending or an anterior rotation. So then how do you treat it? You're going to do the opposite. So what are the antagonist muscles to the quads? You have the hamstrings. So the hamstrings are located on the posterior side of the innominate. If you need to pull the rest of the innominate back into posterior rotation, you're going to treat the hamstrings with muscle energy. You're going to activate the hamstrings, pull that anteriorly rotated innominate back posterior. So you're going to treat with the hamstrings. The quads can cause an anterior rotation, you're going to fix it with the hamstrings. So now you have a posterior rotation. Basically the exact opposite of an anterior rotation, so you're ASIS is going to be superior on the side of the standing flexion test, your PSIS is going to be inferior on the side of the standing flexion test. You're going to have a short leg. It can be caused by the hamstrings and you can treat it with the quads. It's the exact opposite of the anterior rotation. So you have anterior and you have posterior. So I'm going to leave a gap here so we can come into some practice questions a little later on. But the next type of dysfunction that you can have is a shear. Now a shear is basically where one of the innominates is located either superiorly or inferiorly compared to the other side. So you can have a superior shear or an up shear, or you can have a down shear or an inferior shear. So what are your findings going to be for those? So for an up shear, you're going to have an ASIS that is superior on the side of the standing flexion test. You're going to have a PSIS that is also superior on the side of the standing flexion test. And you may even have finding of the pubic tubercle, which would also be superior on the same side as the standing flexion test. So how do we relate this to the leg? Imagine that you have an innominate that's up higher. It's going to pull the rest of the bones with it, so you can imagine that you're going to have a short leg on that side. So short leg. So if you have an up shear, that means that you can also have a down shear. In a down shear, the findings are exactly the opposite as an up shear. So you have an ASIS that is inferior on the side of the positive standing flexion test. PSIS that's also inferior, and a pubic tubercle that is also inferior. The leg length is going to be long. So imagine that the bones are being moved downward, you're going to have a long leg. There are two other types of shears that you can have. You can have a pubic up shear and you can have a pubic down shear. So you can have two other types of shears. You can have a pubic up shear and a pubic down shear. So these findings are very easy to point out. Your pubic tubercle on a pubic up shear will be superior. On a pubic down shear, your pubic tubercle will be inferior. But what about ASIS and PSIS? They're not going to have any landmark findings. So it's only going to be the pubic tubercle that has something. Same thing with a down shear. ASIS, PSIS nothing. Pubic tubercle will be down for a down shear on the side of dysfunction. And the last type of dysfunction that you can have in the innominates is a flare. There are two types. You can either have an in flare or an out flare. That means that one innominate bone is either tilted more inward as an in flare or tilted more outward as an out flare. So for these findings, in flare, your ASIS is going to be medial on the side of dysfunction, and your PSIS will either have no findings at all or will be lateral. And for an out flare, on the theme of being opposite, it's going to be the exact opposite. So you have an out flare, your ASIS is going to be lateral on the same side as your standing flexion test being positive, and your PSIS is either not going to have any findings or it's going to be more medial. So now I have all the findings. How am I going to be able to use this to get the diagnosis without memorizing all these tiny points? This is where the cowabunga hand is going to come in handy. So let's go ahead and write down a practice question. So for number one, we're going to have a standing flexion test that's positive on the right. An ASIS that is inferior on the right, and a PSIS that is superior on the right. So this is where your cowabunga hands are going to come into play. You hold them directly in front of you. Your thumbs are going to be the PSIS and your pinkies will be the ASIS. So what you're going to do is you're going to use the anatomic findings in order to get the correct diagnosis. So for these dysfunctions, remember that you always name the side of the standing flexion test for your diagnosis. So all of your diagnostic findings need to be on that side in order to get the cowabunga hands to work properly. So in this example, the standing flexion test is positive on the right side. The ASIS is located inferiorly on the right compared to the left. So I'm just going to twist my hand forward, so now the pinkie is lower than the other pinkie. The PSIS on the right side is superior on the right, more superior than the PSIS is on the left, which is still where I'm holding my hand. So if I'm looking at this, I can already tell that the right innominate is anteriorly rotated. So the answer is right anterior rotation. So then the second question. Let's say that you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the left, an ASIS that's inferior on the right and a PSIS that is superior on the right. So I just use my cowabunga hands once again. You have a positive standing flexion test on the left. So you're going to name everything based on the left side, which is the abnormal side. On the right you have an inferior ASIS but a superior PSIS. Now the findings are on the other side than the standing flexion test. The standing flexion test is the dysfunction side and the abnormal side, so you have to reverse it. So you move your fingers back into the regular anatomic position, so that now my right side, which is normal, is back in the normal plane and the left side is now dysfunctional. So now when I'm looking at my hand, I can tell that my left side has rotated posteriorly. So the answer is a left posterior rotation. So the next practice question. You have a compression test that's positive on the left and an ASIS that is inferior on the right and a PSIS that is inferior on the left. So remember, the compression test is the same thing as a standing flexion test. This just tells you that your findings are abnormal on the left side. So you need to relate all of the findings back to the left innominate. So your ASIS is inferior on the right side, so you rotate your right hand downward to get your pinkie inferior. The PSIS is inferior on the left side, so you rotate your hand left. So to get the diagnosis, you have to bring your right hand back to neutral because the left side is dysfunctional. So now you have your hands like this, you can tell that your left hand is posteriorly rotated. So you have a left posterior rotation. So let's do some practice questions for shears. So the first question, your standing flexion test is positive on the right. Your ASIS is superior on the right, and your PSIS is superior on the right. So if you're doing your cowabunga hands once again, you have to make sure that all of your findings are on the side of dysfunction, which for this example is going to be for the right. So now using the cowabunga hands, you have your standing flexion test that's positive on the right, which means that all of your diagnostic findings will be on this side. Your ASIS is superior on the right, and your PSIS is also superior on the right. So using this motion, you can tell that the right side is up. So you have a right up shear. Right up shear. Next question, standing flexion test positive on the right. ASIS is superior on the left, PSIS is superior on the left. So using your hands, the right side is dysfunctional. Left ASIS is up, left PSIS is up. Your findings are on the right side, so the right is dysfunctional. If you're looking at it, the right is now lower than the left. The answer is a right down shear. The final shear practice question, you have an ASIS compression test that's positive on the left. You have a pubic tubercle that is superior on the right. You have an ASIS finding of being normal and a PSIS finding of being normal. You can't really use the cowabunga hands for a pubic up shear or down shear. Just memorize it if the pubic tubercle is up and everything's normal, it's pubic up shear. If it's down, pubic down shear. So for this one, you've got a pubic up shear. So now some questions for a flare. You have the standing flexion test that's positive on the right, and you have an ASIS that is medial on the right. So cowabunga hands. Positive on the right side. You're right ASIS is more medial. So when you're doing this motion, you can tell that your right side is going inward, so this is an in flare on the right. So a right in flare. So the standing flexion test is going to be positive on the left and your ASIS is going to be medial on the right. Back to using your hands. The left side is dysfunctional. The right ASIS is located more medial. But you have to bring it back out to neutral so that it makes sense. So when you bring it to neutral, you're going to show that now the left side is an out flare. So bringing it back into neutral. So a left out flare. So if the cowabunga hands made sense to you then you don't really have to worry about anything else and the lecture's over. But if you're the type of person that likes a flow chart and just wants to be able to take the points that are given to you and plug it in somewhere to get the answer, we're going to do a quick flow chart for that. So in order to do that, so the first thing that you're going to do is compare the direction of the ASIS and PSIS on the same side as one another. So your ASIS can either be superior or inferior, and your PSIS can be superior or inferior. If you've noticed, for shears, the ASIS and PSIS are both superior or, for a down shear, the ASIS and PSIS are both going inferiorly on the same side. If you have a rotation that's anterior, the ASIS and PSIS are both located on the same side but pointing in opposite directions. For posterior rotation, the ASIS and PSIS are pointing in different directions but on the same side. So if we're going to use that for our flow chart, you're going to assess which direction the ASIS and PSIS are both pointing on the same side. So if they are both pointing superior or both pointing inferior on the same side, you're going to have a shear. Now if on the same side the ASIS and PSIS are pointed in opposite directions, that's going to tell you that you have some sort of a rotation dysfunction. So the next thing that you're going to do is compare the standing flexion test and the side of the superior ASIS. So if you're on the shear side, you have a standing flexion test that's positive on the same side that the ASIS is superior, you're going to have an up shear. If it's located on opposite sides, so let's say the standing flexion test is positive on the left but the superior ASIS is located on the right, that means that you're going to have a down shear. So now looking back at rotations, you're going to do the same next step. You're going to compare the standing flexion test versus the side of the superior ASIS. If the standing flexion test is positive on the same side as the superior ASIS, you're going to have a posterior rotation. If the side of the superior ASIS is on the opposite of the side of the positive standing flexion test, you're going to have an anterior rotation. So we went over two different methods of diagnosing the innominates during this lecture. We went over the cowabunga hands and we went over the chart. The only other thing that you need to do is assess which side the standing flexion test is positive, the ASIS location, the PSIS location, and the pubic tubercle location. And that's how you diagnose the innominates. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to Counterstrain]  
﻿This section is difficult and it's not very fun to learn. It's called counterstrain. The treatment of counterstrain tender points is pretty simple, but knowing the hundreds of different positions and knowing the exact setup for everything gets pretty complicated and pretty convoluted. So in this lecture, I'm going to teach you the high yield stuff that you have to know to get the questions correct using an advanced organizer, and explain to you that maybe you don't necessarily need to remember all the spots if you remember just to fold and hold. So let's go ahead and start with tender point. So a tender point is what you're going to be treating with counterstrain. A tender point is a hypertonic portion of muscle that is tender when you poke it. It doesn't radiate, it's a tender point. So hypertonic. Now how do you get a tender point to treat? What happens is you stretch a muscle too fast. An example of this would be you're in a car, you're at a red light, you get rear ended from behind. And when that happens, your neck extends very quickly and you get the whiplash motion. All the muscles in the front side of your neck are stretching way too fast than what they usually do. This is going to send a signal to your muscle spindle fibers. They're stretching too fast, they're going to get injured if they keep stretching this fast. So there is a reflex arc that says, slow down, contract the muscle. And when that happens, your muscle is then going to contract forcefully. So in our whiplash example, you get hit from behind, extend your neck in the whiplash, muscle spindle fibers get activated, tell you to flex your neck forcefully. And now, this is where the tender point will be, the anterior cervical area. Muscles are too contracted. So how do we treat this? When you're doing the treatment, it's very important to follow every single step exactly the same. What they will test you on in exam is making sure that you're following the steps exactly how they should be. So any counterstrain point, you have to treat it the same. So as we mentioned in the previous lecture, counterstrain is an indirect treatment, meaning that you put it into the freedom, you put it into the position of ease. So in our whiplash example, if the muscles on the anterior side of the neck are flexed and contracted, that means it is easy for them to flex but it's very difficult to go back into extension. So if I put it into flexion or into the freedom, that's indirect. So indirect and passive. And again, passive means that the patient does not participate in the treatment. The practitioner is moving them for themselves. So then what? You need to find the tender point and then you need to poke it and make the pain scale. So you find the tender point on the front of the patient's neck, you push on it and you ask them, how painful is that? And they're going to tell you it hurts ten out of ten, whatever. Whatever they say, you need to tell the patient that during the treatment, that pain that you're feeling right now is going to be considered a ten out of ten. So the next part is to passively move the patient into the treatment position. Now that you're in this position, you're going to poke the tender point again, and you're going to ask how painful is it? And they're going to tell you it's decreased. You ask where it is on the pain scale, and if they said it is three or less, you know that you're in the correct position for treatment. If they say anything other than three or less, you need to readjust your position to make sure the pain is less than three. Once you're here, you need to hold this position for 90 seconds. Once you hold for 90 seconds, then you can return the patient back to neutral. Once they're back in neutral, you continue to poke on the area and ask how is it now? Is it still painful? So you're rescreening to see if your treatment worked. An important part of this treatment is to know where you place your finger and when to lift it up. So once you find the tender point, you poke on the point. You keep your finger on the tender point. Once they give you the pain scale, you keep your finger on the point but you release pressure, so you're just monitoring. Move them to passive, reassess pain by adding pressure and poking on it, keep the finger on the point to monitor, hold for 90 seconds, passive to neutral, and then you can rescreen by poking on it. During the entire treatment, you never lift up your finger. You just adjust the pressure that you're putting on it. So now that you know the steps to treatment, we're going to go over some of the high yield points for you to know in the cervical spine, thoracic, lumbar and ribs. So you have anterior and posterior points. Anterior cervical, anterior thoracic, anterior lumbar and anterior ribs. And the organizer that we're going to use is going to be SARA. We're going to get really familiar with SARA during this talk. So we're going to write out SR for all the spots. Now calling back to the previous lectures, S and R mean side bending and rotation. All that we need to fill in is a directionality for each treatment point. So like I said, we're going to get very familiar with SARA. So any of the anterior cervical points, you're going to side bend away and rotate away. For the thoracic spine, it's going to be a little bit different. So you're going to rotate away but you're going to side bend towards. For anterior lumbar, you take the thoracic and you flip it. So you got side bend away and rotate towards. And then you got ribs. Ribs are different. They're not part of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. So they're going to be different than SARA. They're going to be side bend toward, rotate toward. Now what does toward and away mean? Each of these points can be located midline or lateral. When you're treating the lateral points on the right side and you want to side bend away, rotate away, you're going to side bend to the left and rotate to the left. If you want to side bend and rotate toward the right, side bend toward the right, rotate toward the right. That's treatment position. So the last component is the flexion and extension. Like I said earlier, fold and hold is going to be the easy way to remember all these. And since this is all anterior, how do you fold up the front? You go into flexion. So these are the basic anterior points for you to know. Now you need to learn the posterior. So you have posterior cervical, posterior thoracic, posterior lumbar and posterior ribs. For the posterior points, it's important to delineate between midline and lateral points. So cervical, you have a midline point and a lateral point. For thoracic you have a midline and lateral. We'll go over midline in a second. So let's just worry about lateral. For lumbar, you have a midline and a lateral, and for ribs you don't have midline or lateral. So now going back to our SARA pneumonic, she really helps us out a lot for the posterior side, because all of them are going to be side bend away, rotate away. The final portion is flexion or extension. So if it's in the back and you want to fold and hold those back muscles, you're going to extend. Now just like the anterior points and ribs being very different, just like that for posterior. The posterior point is going to be very different. So instead of extension, you're going to go into flexion. So these are all the normal points for the cervical spine, thoracic, lumbar and for the ribs of the anterior and posterior sides. So going over the organizer again, if it's anterior you always flex it to fold and hold. For cervical spine, SARA's our friend. Side bend away, rotate away. For thoracic spine, you side bend towards and rotate away. Lumbar you flip it, so you side bend away, rotate toward, and ribs are totally different. So you side bend toward, rotate toward. For the posterior points, you always extend except for ribs, which are weird, they flex. And the rest of them SARA is still our friend, so you side bend away and you rotate away. So now you have what we call the maverick points. They don't follow the fold and hold rules very well. So during an exam, it's more likely that you're going to get asked about a maverick point instead of one of these points. These are really easy to memorize, fold and hold. The mavericks take a little bit more memorization. So the first point is going to be anterior cervical 1. This point is located right behind the mandible, up high near the ear, AC1. Now it's AC1, there's only one motion, and it's going to be rotate away. One motion. So don't worry about flexion, don't worry about extension, don't worry about side bending. One motion, rotate away. The next point is going to be AC7. AC7 is located at the sternoclavicular joint, the SC joint. This is where your SCM attaches to your clavicle and sternum. When you think about what motion does the SCM do, it side bends towards and rotates away to shorten the muscle. So using fold and hold, if you want to shorten that muscle, you're going to do what it does. So you are going to flex, side bend toward and rotate away. Another way to remember this is that this motion is just like the thoracic spine, flex, side bend toward, rotate away. If it helps, just remember thoracic spine minus one vertebra, and now you're at AC7. So flex, side bend toward, rotate away. The next maverick point is going to be anterior thoracic points 1 through 6. Now when you're doing these points, there's only one motion that you need to do. It's located on the anterior side, flex forward. So all you do is flex. No side bending, no rotation, flex. Next you have the anterior lumbar points. You have the AL1 and AL5. Now where are these located? These are located on the ASIS in the AIIS. So if you're looking at a picture of where these would be, you can imagine this is the sacrum, this is your hip bone, the ASIS is located up top and the AIIS is located more inferior. So when I'm palpating these structures, AL1 is going to be located at the ASIS, point 2 is going to be located medial to the AIIS, point 3 is lateral and point 4 is inferior. Point 5 is located on the pubic tubercle. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ASIS, AIIS, pubic tubercle. So going back to how to treat AL1, the position is going to be just like AC7. So you're going to flex, you're going to side bend towards, and you're going to rotate away. So just how one of our organizers was AC7 is thoracic spine minus one, you can remember AL1 is thoracic spine plus one. So AL1, flex, side bend toward, rotate away. Then you have AL5, which was located on the pubic tubercle. This treatment position is going to be F, side bend away and rotate away. I'll let you make up your own pneumonic for that one. So then you have the maverick points for the posterior side. You have posterior cervical point 1, located in the midline. So just like AC1, this midline point of number 1 is going to have one motion, and it's going to be flexion. No side bending, no rotation, just flexion. Maverick point because since it's on the posterior side and you're thinking of fold and hold, you'd want to extend. But for this point you flex. Next point is going to be posterior cervical point 3, located in the midline. Now this one, SARA's going to be your friend again. So F, side bend away and rotate away. So this is maverick because it's on the posterior side and you want to extend, but in reality you flex. So it's maverick. F, side bend away, rotate away. So then you have posterior thoracic midline points. So all of the points in the midline for posterior thoracic are going to be treated this way. The way that you treat these is extension. You don't do anything else. No rotation, no side bending, just extension. Easy to remember that because it's on the posterior side and you want to shorten the muscles there, you're just going to extend. It's a maverick point because there's no side bending and no rotation. Last point is going to be your posterior rib point for number 1, for rib number 1. The way that you treat this is you are going to put the patient into extension, you're going to side bend away, and you're going to rotate towards. So some of these points you just have to memorize. I don't have a pneumonic for it. So posterior rib point 1, E, side bend away, rotate toward. You just got to memorize it. So we're going to close out this lecture by discussing the difference between tender points and trigger points. They both don't have anything to do with each other, other than they both start with the letter T so they can be confused by students very easily. So there's differences between trigger points and tender points. So a tender point is what we've been talking about this entire time. It's a singular point. Now when you poke it, the pain does not radiate. And the way that you treat a tender point is with counterstrain. A trigger point, which you should be calling a trigger band so that you don't confuse the two with one another, isn't a singular point but it's an entire band that's tight. And when you poke on this band, the pain will radiate. And when you find a trigger band, you're going to treat it with myofascial, which we will discuss in one of the next lectures. So completely different than the rest of the lecture and doesn't help with counterstrain, but still very important to know the difference between a tender point and a trigger band. So during this lecture, we talked all about counterstrain. We went over what a tender point is, how it starts, the exact treatment order, which you must follow every time, the difference between tender and trigger points, and try to give you an advanced organizer for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and rib counterstrain points so that you can get this stuff right. And that's counterstrain. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to OMM v2]  
﻿Learning OMM is a lot like learning a completely new language. You have to understand the basic vocabulary before you can understand everything else that's to come. The way that the OMM course is laid out is in a very specific order. So, you should watch this video lecture series in that specific order. It's so that these concepts and core ideas will start to build on top of one another, so it all makes sense. For you to do well in osteopathy, of course, you need to learn what I'm saying, but you also need to have a deep understanding of the core concepts. When you're taking an exam or you're in the clinic, you're going to see things that you haven't exactly studied before but if you understand the core concepts of osteopathy, you should be able to tackle just about anything that's thrown at you. So, to start off, we'll say what is a dysfunction. So, a dysfunction is simply an abnormal function of normal anatomy. So, let's say that you can typically flex your arm and extend your arm. If you can't flex your arm all the way, that's an abnormal function of the anatomy that's going to be a dysfunction. So, dysfunction is abnormal anatomy. So, how are we going to name these dysfunctions, so that each physician knows what the other physician is talking about? We're going to name them somatic dysfunctions. So, how are we going to name it? This is going to seem pretty weird, but you want to name it by what it can do. Now, you may be thinking that you want to say what the muscle can't do, but it's the opposite. You always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So, in our example for the patient that wasn't able to flex his arm, but he can extend his arm all the way out, this is going to be called an extension dysfunction. He can extend, he cannot flex, it's called an extension dysfunction. So, you always name it a somatic dysfunction by what it can do. Always by what it can do. So, when you're palpating or assessing a somatic dysfunction with your hands, you're going to have different palpatory findings based off if the dysfunction is acute or brand-new, or if it's chronic and it's been lingering around for a while. These different palpatory changes are called your TART findings and TART stands for Texture, Asymmetry, Restriction and Tenderness. So, if you're palpating and assessing an acute dysfunction, the tissue texture may be hot or boggy, or maybe even moist. So, imagine if you just stubbed your toe, it might feel pretty hot if you touch it. It might even feel pretty moist. Acute dysfunction. It just happened. It's hot and burning. Asymmetry, you're going to notice palpable asymmetry on both sides of the dysfunction. For restriction when you ask the patient to move, it's going to be painful on motion. So back to our patient who stubbed his toe, if we ask him to move his toe around, it may be really painful at first. That's going to tell you it's an acute dysfunction. Now, what about tenderness? For tenderness of an acute dysfunction it's going to be sharp pain. Now imagine if you just stubbed your toe, you don't want anyone cramming their fingers on it that's going to hurt, so it's sharp pain. So just remember if you have an acute dysfunction think of these red-hot findings. Now we are going to compare this to a chronic dysfunction. The tissue texture is going to be cool or ropy or maybe even dry. So, if they stub their toe last week and you're going to palpate that toe, it's probably going to feel a little bit cooler than it did when it was an acute injury. You're still going to have palpable asymmetry, but when you ask the patient to move around, they're going to have a decreased pain or maybe they won't have any pain when they move. So, asking the patient to move their stubbed toe that they stabbed last week, it may not be hurtful. So, for tenderness, it's going to feel like dull achy pain. If they stub their toe last week and you're pushing on it, it may just feel dull, because it's starting to heal. So, when you think of chronic dysfunctions, think of cool blue findings and compare that to acute dysfunctions, which would be red-hot findings. So, the next thing that you need to understand our planes and axes of motion and to do that, we're going to draw out some pictures. So, a plane is simply a flat surface and this flat surface is going to be a surface where motion occurs or where you divide the body. There are three different planes that you need to know. The first plane is going to be the sagittal plane. The sagittal plane is going to divide the body right down the bridge of the nose and it's going to split both sides of the body into two equal parts. The next plane is the transverse plane. The transverse plane is going to split the body horizontally. So, if that transverse plane is going from hip to hip, you're going to have a superior side and an inferior side, two different sections. The third plane of motion is going to be your coronal plane. Now imagine that you're wearing a crown, a crown for coronal. It's going to divide your body between an anterior and posterior point going down the ears. So, split your body into an anterior and posterior side. Now this is going to be compared to an access. An access is just a singular point that the body will move around and there are three different axes that you need to be aware of. The first axis is a horizontal axis. It goes horizontally through the body. It's a singular point. So, imagine the pen is the horizontal axis going from hip to hip. It's that singular point. The next axis is a vertical axis that goes vertically through the body. So, the vertical axis will be going from my head to feet and the third axis is an AP axis, or anterior posterior, goes from the anterior to posterior side. Now these axes can be located anywhere on the body. For example, an AP axis could be at the chest, on the foot, in the hand, on the head wherever, you just need to understand that motion will occur around the axis. So, there are three primary motions of the body and we're going to relate those to the planes and axes of motion. The three type of body movements are going to be flexion and extension, rotation and side bending and we are going to talk about how these motions occur on a specific plane and around a specific axis. So, what is flexion and extension. Flexion is just bending forward. It's approximating two ends of whatever joint that you're doing. So, in this example, the joint would be from your chest to your knees. You're bending forward to bring the two ends closer together, that's flexion. Extension is going the opposite direction, bringing both ends further away from one another. So flexion is forward, extension is backward. Now how does this relate to planes and axes of motion? The motion will occur o a plane and around an axis. So, for example think of an umbrella. An umbrella has a handle and a canopy that protects you from the rain. When you twist the handle, it's going to twist the canopy on the top. Now imagine that the handle is your access and the umbrella canopy is your plane of motion. That plane of motion is going around the axis that you're spinning. So, for flexion and extension, it's going to be on a sagittal plane and around a horizontal axis. So using our umbrella example, imagine the umbrella handle is going from hip to hip. When you twist the handle forward that's going to cause flexion and when you twist the handle backward around the axis that's going to cause extension. So, flexion extension on a sagittal plane, but around a horizontal axis. Now rotation is going to be on the transverse plane and on a vertical axis. So back to our umbrella example, imagine that you have a vertical axis. You're twisting the handle and now the body is rotating around that axis. And finally, for side bending that's going to occur on a coronal plane and around an AP axis. So, with the umbrella example again the AP axis going through, you're going to twist the umbrella handle and that's going to cause motion in those directions. So, side bending occurs on a coronal plane around an AP axis. If it helps you remember, think of the colors. Green flexion extension, sagittal horizontal blue and red. The next concept that you need to understand are the barriers of motion. To demonstrate the barrier, I'm going to draw one vertebra looking from the top down and there are different barriers that you need to understand. The first is neutral. Now neutral is where the body anatomy is going to lie when the patient is relaxed or there in neutral. So, if I'm just standing comfortably wherever my spine is is going to be considered neutral. So neutral is in a relaxed position. The next barrier is going to be the physiologic barrier. So, what's this? Imagine that you're rotating your neck, you're using your neck muscles to induce that rotation. However far you can contract your muscles to rotate your head is the physiologic barrier. So, if I'm actively contracting my muscles and I can look over my shoulder and not go any further, that's the physiologic barrier. So active motion or using your own muscles. The next barrier is going to be the anatomic barrier. Now the anatomic barrier is a little bit further than the physiologic barrier. Imagine a physician comes and he tries to rotate your neck. He can probably go just a little bit further than you're able to go by contracting your muscles. That newly found barrier is going to be the anatomic barrier. That's the maximum length that the anatomy can go without causing structural damage. That'll be the anatomic barrier, which you can reach through passive motion. One final barrier that you need to be aware of is the restrictive barrier. Now the restrictive barrier is an abnormal barrier. It's abnormally functioning anatomy. So back to our head turning example, if you can turn your head all the way to the right normally, but when you try and rotate the other direction, it doesn't want to go very far and it stops before the physiologic barrier, that's going to be the restrictive barrier. Now the restrictive barrier is what you're going to name somatic dysfunctions on. So restrictive is the abnormal barrier. So back to our head rotation example, you can rotate to the left, but you cannot rotate to the right. You always name it by what it can do, so don't get tripped up. So, you can rotate to left, so this is a left rotation dysfunction. Remember always name by what you can do. In the example that we drew with the vertebra, you can rotate the segment to the right all the way to the anatomic barrier, but when you begin to rotate to the left, you're going to reach the restricted barrier very quickly. You can't rotate left, but you can rotate right. So, it's a right rotation this function. The final piece of vocabulary that you need to know are muscle contraction types. The first muscle contraction type is isotonic and there are two versions. The first is concentric. So, what is a concentric contraction? A concentric contraction is when you activate your muscle and it's going to bring the origin and insertion or the two ends of the muscle closer together. So, to imagine this in realistic terms when you're in the gym, you're lifting weights for your bicep curls, you're activating your biceps and you're bringing the two ends of the muscle closer together during your positive motion. This is going to be a concentric contraction. So, it's a contraction that leads to approximation of the ends of the muscle. Now the other type of isotonic contraction is Eccentric. This is where when you're contracting the muscle, an elongation is going to occur bringing the two ends of the muscle further apart from one another. Back to our gym example you're doing your positives, which is a concentric contraction. When you start to release a little bit of pressure, but you're still contracting and going down into your negative motion, that's going to be eccentric contraction. You're still contracting your biceps, but you're going out further. So, the two ends of the muscle get further apart. The next type of muscle contraction is going to be isolytic. Now this muscle contraction is where an outside force comes and breaks the patient's muscle contraction force thus causing a rapid elongation of the muscle and separating the two ends of the muscle. For an example, imagine that someone's arm wrestling. Both people are contracting their arms together, but eventually one of them is going to win and break the contraction of the other person. That breaking is isolytic contraction. So, breaking the force. The final type of contraction is going to be isometric. Now in osteopathy isometric is probably going to be the most important type of muscle contraction. This is a type of muscle contraction that you are going to perform on your patients when you're treating them with muscle energy. We'll discuss that in one of the next videos. Isometric contraction is when the patient is making a contraction, but there is an outside force probably from the physician that's equal and because of that both forces cancel out and there's no approximation or lengthening of the muscle, even though the muscle is still contracted. So, two different forces coming together that equal each other out. Both muscles are contracted, but the ends are not approximating or elongating. So, there's no change in the ends of the muscle during an isometric contraction. So, we went over a lot of stuff, but it's really important that you understand the vocabulary before you move on trying to understand the rest of OMM. We discussed what a dysfunction is and how you name it by what it can do. We discussed the TART changes for red-hot acute dysfunctions and cool blue dysfunctions for chronic. We talked about planes and axes of motion. We went over the different barriers that you can reach and we wrapped it up with different types of muscle contractions and that's your introduction to OMM. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Introduction to OMM]  
﻿Learning OMM is a lot like learning a completely different language. You have to learn the vocabulary first so you can understand everything that's to come later on. The way that this course is laid out is in a very particular order. So if you watch it in that order, all the topics, concepts and language that we use is introduced throughout, so that at the end it all makes sense. For you to do well in this course, not only do you need to understand the information that I give you, but you also need to be able to learn the concepts and be able to apply the concepts to different situations. When you take an exam, you're going to see information that you haven't seen before, and what the exam writer is wanting to do is to see if you know the concepts. So in this lecture we're going to go over some of the basic vocabulary that you're going to use for the rest of the course. So to start off with, what is a dysfunction? A dysfunction is basically an abnormal function of normal anatomy. So what you can and cannot do. So an example of this would be normally I can flex my arm all the way in, I can extend my arm all the way out. If I cannot bring my arm all the way into flexion, that's what we would call a somatic dysfunction. So abnormal function of anatomy. So how do we name a dysfunction? How do we know between each practitioner what we're talking about? What you need to do is you need to name the dysfunction for what the segment can do. It sounds confusing because you want to say that the arm cannot flex, so you think that you want to say can't flex. In reality, what you say is the patient has a extension dysfunction, which means that they can extend and they cannot flex. So you always name it by what it can do. So how do I find some of these dysfunctions? What are some of the palpatory findings I'm going to see? This is what classifies as a TART change, and TART stands for texture, asymmetry, restriction and tenderness. And depending on if the dysfunction is acute or chronic, you're going to have different findings for each section. If you have an acute dysfunction and you're palpating the tissues, you're going to feel hot tissues or boggy or even moist. So think about it as being brand new. It's still red hot. So the dysfunctional palpatory findings will be hot, boggy, moist when you palpate the skin. When you do your palpation, you're also going to feel asymmetry, so one side is not going to feel the same way that the other side will feel. It'll feel asymmetric. For restriction, we're really talking about pain on motion. So since it's brand new, it's an acute dysfunction, you can imagine that there's going to be a lot of pain on movement. So let's say if the patient just hurt their back and they just got a spine somatic dysfunction, when they bend forward or try and rotate, it may be very painful. And this is telling you that it's an acute dysfunction. For tenderness, they're doing the quality of the pain. So if it's acute, the pain will be intense or sharp. So if I take my thumb and I jam it, whatever muscle is dysfunctional is going to feel intense, it's going to feel sharp. So if on an exam you have any of these findings, the exam writer is trying to tell you that it's an acute dysfunction. And then we're going to compare that to chronic. Chronic or ongoing dysfunction is going to have palpatory findings that are basically the opposite of acute. So you're going to feel cool tissues or they're going to be ropey tissues or they'll be dry tissues. When you're feeling for symmetry, you're still going to palpate asymmetry, so that's going to be the same for acute and for chronic. If it's a chronic dysfunction, it's been lingering a little while. The rest of your body is starting to compensate, so it may have decreased pain on motion or even no pain on motion at all. And if it's been sitting around a while, it's not going to be nearly as intense or nearly as sharp as it was when it first occurred. So it's going to be more of an achy pain or a dull pain. So when you jam your thumb into it, it feels more achy or it feels more dull. So there are three primary motions that occur in every segment. You can have flexion, which is bending forward or anteriorly, you can have extension, which is bending back posteriorly. You can have rotation, which is turning your body, and you can have side bending, which is moving your body to the left and to the right like this. Each of these motions occur in a plane, in a round and axis. So to label the planes of motion, we're going to use some pictures. So a plane of motion, you can almost imagine it as if the body is being cut directly in the motion, and you're getting two equal slices on each side. So for a sagittal plane, it's a plane that cuts right along the bridge of the nose and goes directly down the rest of the body. So you're going to be split right down the middle like this. For a transverse plane, it's going to go from ear to ear. It's going to go horizontally. So transverse plane would be if I get a cut right here and I can separate the top half and the lower half of my body into two completely different segments. So the last plane is the coronal plane. Now this plane, imagine if you're wearing a crown for your coronal plane, and it cuts directly down the middle. So it'll be a slice just right here and it will fold out your body like this. So next there are three axes of motion. You can have a horizontal axis, which is a singular line that goes through the body. So imagine if I take the pen, push it through my body, that's the axis. You're not cutting the entire body, it's a singular point. So horizontal axis goes from hip to hip. A vertical axis goes from the top of the body all the way down to the bottom. So if I take the same pen, through the head, out the feet, that's the vertical axis. And finally, you have an AP axis, or an anterior posterior axis. It goes directly from the anterior side to the posterior side. So if I push directly towards me. Now each of these axes can be moved slightly around the body, depending on where you want to be turning. So the AP axis can be located in the center, it can be located around the neck, on the hand, wherever. But wherever the axis is, the rest of the rotational component will occur around that axis. So now to talk about flexion, extension and side bending. So each of these motions will occur on a plane and around an axis. So the easiest way to think about this would be think about an umbrella. An umbrella has a handle and it also has a gigantic upper part that protects you from the rain. If you're twisting the handle around, the top part will spin around as well. If you imagine the handle of the umbrella is the axis and the umbrella itself is the plane, then that gives you an idea of how the planes of motion actually work around each axis. So if we're talking about flexion and extension, we need to relate that to the umbrella. The easiest way would be to stick one of your arms up and then flex and extend. And when I'm making that motion, I'm drawing the plan with my arm going around. And that plane is going to be a sagittal plane. Now with that same analogy, imagine that I'm taking an axis and going 90 degrees at the plane, which means that it will go directly through my hips. So if I take that umbrella handle and twist it, I'm flexing forward and I am extending backwards. So the plane that flexion extension occurs on is the sagittal plan, and the axis that it goes around is horizontal. Now for rotation, it's the same umbrella idea. If I stick my arms out and I rotate, I'm drawing the transverse plane with my arms. If I'm wanting to do the rotation on the umbrella stick, I'm twisting my body around it, so it's going to be the vertical axis. And for side bending, the same idea. If I stick my arm out and I side bend, I can draw the plane with my arm. That plane that I'm drawing is the coronal plane, and the 90 degree axis is going to be the AP axis. So now that you understand the axes and planes of each motion, you need to understand the barriers and you need to learn the vocabulary for barriers. So to do this, we are going to look at a single vertebral unit. So there are a few different barriers that you need to learn the names of. The first one is neutral. So in neutral, the patient is totally relaxed. They're sitting still. This is how the anatomy normally sits in neutral. So relaxed. The next barrier is going to be the physiologic barrier. Now if I'm going to take my vertebral segment and rotate around this axis and I get to the P, that's the physiologic barrier. Now physiologic is the range of motion that the patient has during active movement. So if I am actively trying to rotate my head to the right and that's as far as I can go, that's the physiologic barrier. So active motion. The next barrier that you're going to hit is the anatomic barrier. Now, if the practitioner comes in and they decide that they're going to rotate my head, they can probably move my head more in the rotation than I would be on my own. So that passive motion is going to reach a further barrier. That's the anatomic barrier. Now the final barrier that you need to understand is the restrictive barrier. So the restrictive barrier is some sort of abnormal barrier, a barrier where you shouldn't be stuck at. So if I'm rotating this vertebral segment all the way down to the left, so if I'm rotating to the left, I should be able to passively move the segment all the way to the anatomic barrier. But if I get stuck here and I can only rotate a little bit, that's the restrictive barrier. Now once again, they're not able to rotate all the way to the restrictive barrier. This is confusing because of how you want to name the diagnosis. Remember, you always want to name it based off what it can do. So it seems backwards, because you want to say it's stuck rotated in this direction. In reality, you want to say what it can do. So it can rotate the other direction normally, and that's what you would name it on. So the last thing that you need to understand is the types of muscle contractions. And there are two types of isotonic muscle contractions. You have concentric and eccentric. Now concentric muscle contraction is when the patient actively contracts their muscle, it brings the origin and the insertion closer together. So if I am concentrically contracting my bicep, I'm bringing my arm further this direction. So one way to think about it would be you're at the gym, you're doing your positives for your gains, you're bringing your arm up, that's a concentric motion. An eccentric contraction is a lengthening of the muscle while the patient is still contracting the muscle. Easy way to think about eccentric contraction is if you're still in the gym, you're doing your negatives, so you've already flexed up. You have the weight, you're still contracting the muscle, but you're slowly elongating the muscle. This elongation is eccentric. Next type of muscle contraction is isolytic. Isolytic is where an outside force breaks the patient's muscle contraction 100 percent. So the easiest way to think about this would be if you are arm wrestling someone who is bigger than you. When you're arm wrestling, you're holding it steady, but eventually their strength overtakes you and you let it go. That is isolytic. It's breaking your muscle contraction. And the final muscle contraction type is isometric. Isometric is the most important muscle contraction for osteopathy. This is the type of muscle contraction that we're going for during most of our treatments. So isometric means that the amount of contraction that the patient is exhibiting is the same amount of contraction that the practitioner is exhibiting, so both forces cancel each other out. So even though I'm pushing, I'm not elongating and I'm not shortening the muscle group. So that's isometric. So this is the vocabulary that you're going to need to continue with the rest of the course. We started off with what is a dysfunction? How do you name the dysfunction? TART changes for acute and chronic dysfunctions. Planes of motion, axes of motion with our umbrella. Then specific barriers, including neutral, physiologic, anatomic and restrictive, and different types of muscle contractions. And that's the introduction for OMM. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Lumbar Spine and Psoas]  
﻿This lecture is about the lumbar area. It's more of a miscellaneous lecture just to pick up bits and pieces that didn't really fit into other discussions. So we're going to break this lecture into three big groups. We're going to talk about diagnosis of the lumbar vertebra, we're going to talk about large muscle groups and how to treat with myofascial, and then we're going to close out with the very important muscle, psoas. So we're going to start out with how to diagnose the lumbar spine. So the way that you're going to do this is the exact same way that you diagnose the thoracic spine. So you're going to assess for rotation in neutral, you're going to assess for rotation in flexion, extension, use Fryette's laws, it's exactly the same as thoracic spine. So that's the first block of this lecture. Lumbar spine is the exact same as thoracic spine. So now we're going to move over to muscle groups and how to treat with myofascial. You can use myofascial technique to treat many different muscles, but the easiest way to go over an example is going to be the large muscles of the spine. So to do that, we're going to first draw a picture. This will give you an idea of what we're talking about. So the large muscles groups that we're going to go over are the erector spinae, and this includes spinalis, which runs closest to the spine. This includes the longissimus, which is the next muscle lateral, and this includes the iliocostalis, which is the most lateral. Then you have multifidus, which runs close to the spine but is the deepest of the muscles that we're going to discuss, and then you have quadratus lumborum. So the reason that we're going to name these muscles is so that we can go over how to use myofascial technique to treat it. So let's say that we have a dysfunction in one of these muscles. When one of these muscles is dysfunctional, it's going to become hypertonic. So if you think about what these muscles originally do, they're located on the posterior side of the body near the spine. They're going to assist in extension of just standing up straight. So we're going to use these muscles to talk about how to use the myofascial technique. And this is a good time to remind you that OMM is a lot about learning the concepts of treatment. So myofascial is not necessarily the best way to treat these muscle groups, it's just one way that you can treat them. If you want to think up a way to use muscle energy, that's acceptable. If you want to use counterstrain, if you want to, then that's acceptable. But this is an easy group to talk about how to use myofascial. So the idea behind myofascial is that you're going to balance the tissue in three planes of motion. You're going to use traction, rotation and compression. So you're going to palpate the back of where the muscle groups are and you're going to add linear traction, either along the muscle or parallel to the muscle. You're going to include rotation of the muscle, which is just like a clock face, clockwise or counterclockwise, and then you can add compression to the muscle to really engage the tissue. If it's a superficial muscle, you don't have to use as much compression. If you're talking about a deep muscle like multifidus, you may need to add more compression to engage the tissues. So which direction do I move the tissues? So as we discussed in one of the previous sections, myofascial technique can be direct or indirect. Remember that direct means engaging the barrier and indirect means engaging the freedom, or doing what the muscle can do. So for our example, these muscle groups induce spinal extension. So if these muscle groups are hypertonic and the origin and insertion come closer together, that's going to be into extension. So the freedom of motion for these dysfunctional muscles will be extension. The barrier will be what they cannot do, which is elongating the muscle into flexion. So if we're going to engage the direct barrier, for this example that means that we're going to push into flexion or we are going to elongate the muscles. The way that we're going to do this is add traction, rotation and compression to the muscle in order to elongate it, or until we feel a hard end feel during treatment. Now we're going to do the opposite of that for indirect. We're going to engage the freedom, meaning that during our traction, rotation and compression, we are going to move the muscle into the position of ease or the position where it wants to go to the freedom. So as we're doing this, we're going to know we're in the right spot when the tissues feel loose under our hands after we've applied the three planes of motion. Also, as we discussed in one of the previous lectures, myofascial technique can either be active or passive. And the way that this is going to come into play is by using enhancers. Enhancers is another way that you can change the technique in order to best fit your patient. So if we're going to use enhancers for this treatment, I'm going to set the patient up into the three planes and either engage the direct or indirect barrier, and then I'm going to ask the patient to flex the muscle groups. So I'm going to ask him to extend his spine to engage these muscles. That's going to be your enhancer, and that makes it an active technique. If you are going to use enhancers for different muscle groups, you're just going to have them engage whatever muscle you're treating. So if you're doing myofascial to the diaphragm, you're going to ask the patient to inhale and exhale to engage the diaphragm. So once you have the patient in the correct barrier and you are using enhancers or not, you hold until you feel a release. Now the release can be one of many things. It can either be a warmth feeling, it can be a rush of fluid, it can be the tissues melting under your hands or becoming loose. You just hold it until you feel that feeling. Once you're there, you can release the three planes of motion, return to neutral, and always rescreen. For any treatment that you do, regardless of if it's myofascial, muscle energy, counterstrain, whatever, when you're done with the treatment you have to rescreen to assess for efficacy. So now we're going to leave myofascial behind, and this is part three of the lecture. This muscle is a board's favorite. It always shows up. It's the psoas muscle. An important concept to understand is where the muscle originates and where it inserts. This can give you a lot of information on what the muscle does and how you can best treat it. So the origin of the muscle is T12 to L5. And the insertion is the lesser trochanter of the femur. So if I'm going to draw a picture of where this muscle is, where this is the sacrum and this is the spine, it's going to attach to the lesser trochanter right here. So what's the action of this muscle? Well, if you think about it conceptually, when a muscle contracts it just brings the origin and insertion of the muscle closer together. So if you know that the origin is on the spine and the insertion is on the lesser trochanter of the femur and you contract the muscle, you're going to induce hip flexion, and it can also induce very slight external rotation of the leg. So what do you have if the muscle is dysfunctional? How do you tell in a patient? What are some of the findings that you'll see? So if it's dysfunctional, the patient may present with lower back pain. If you imagine that the muscle is hypertonic and they're constantly contracted, they may have some lower back pain. Easy one. The next one that you will see is a pelvic shift. So to demonstrate this, I'll do another picture. So here's your sacrum, here's your spine, here's your femur. And the psoas muscle is now hyper-contracted. This hypercontraction leads to the pelvic shift. So if this is contracted on the right side, you can imagine that the patient's pelvis is going to be shifted to the left. So if I'm going to demonstrate this, if my right psoas is contracted, making me lean this direction, my pelvis is now shifted to the left. Another finding that you may see is gait dysfunction. So as you can imagine, if someone has a pretty severe pelvic shift and they're stuck in this position, when they're walking they're going to have to compensate for that shift. So they're going to have some sort of gait abnormalities. Another thing that you may find is an increased lumbar lordosis. As the psoas contracts, it's going to change around your lumbosacral angle. And this lumbosacral angle can also be called a Ferguson angle. This angle basically explains how tipped forward your sacrum is in relation to your pelvic anatomy. So the more that you dip into flexion, the more intense your lumbosacral angle will be, which will then include an increased lumbar lordosis. Another finding that you'll see a positive Thomas test. The Tomas test is when you have a patient laying on the table supine, and they have both of their legs dangling off of the edge of the table. You ask the patient to raise one of their legs up and bring their knee close to their chest. If the other side psoas muscle is dysfunctional or contracted, the other leg will passively come off the table as well. It's going to be pulled off the table by this hypertonic psoas muscle. And one final finding that you're going to have is spinal dysfunction. So as you can imagine, since the origin of the psoas is on part of the spine, if it contracts it's going to induce flexion, rotation and side bending ipsilaterally, so to the same side of dysfunction. So what can cause one of these dysfunctions? There are a few different ways that it can happen. One way is by bending forward. So let's say that you have a patient come in. He's having gait dysfunction and a positive Thomas test. He also explains that he's a carpenter and he is constantly bent over his work table for long periods of time. That excess bending forward can induce a psoas dysfunction. Another cause of dysfunction can be if you activate the muscle too quickly, as in getting out of a chair. Imagine you're calling your grandpa sitting at home. He's sitting in his chair, he hears the phone ring, and he jumps up because he's so excited. That quick jumping motion can cause a psoas dysfunction. So not only can you get a dysfunction through movement, but you can also get a dysfunction throughout other body organs. So one test favorite is ureteral calculi. If you think about anatomically where the ureters lie, they run over the psoas muscle. So if there is a calculus found inside of the ureter and it starts to become inflamed and bother the tissues around it, it can cause a psoas dysfunction. Same concept behind diverticulosis. So we have the patient, have how to identify it and we have what causes it. So how do we treat it? So once again, you have to bring up concepts from the past. So you can treat this using multiple different strategies that we have learned in the past. You can use muscle energy. You just have to remember how muscle energy works. So you stretch the muscle, engage the barrier, ask the patient to isometrically contract. If you want to, you can try and use myofascial. It may be difficult to use myofascial because you're not going to be able to compress the psoas muscle as well without squishing their organs. Or you can do everyone's favorite, counterstrain. Remember, counterstrain is an indirect technique. That's why we're going to write it in blue. So if you want to find the tender point, you have to know where the ASIS is and where the umbilicus is. Once that you know where these two landmarks are, you then have to travel two-thirds of the distance between them and palpate deep. That's where the tender point will be for the psoas muscle. Now if you want to treat it using counterstrain, what do you have to remember? Fold and hold. So the easiest way to think about fold and hold is put the muscle where it can go. Do what the muscle does when it contracts. So what does the muscle do when it contracts? Goes into flexion and it externally rotates. So if you're going to treat using counterstrain, flex the spine, side bend the side towards the muscle, and if you need to adjust a tiny bit, you can induce a little bit of external rotation of the leg. So once again, applying this to what we know about what the muscle does, the muscle flexes the spine, side bends the spine toward the side of dysfunction, and slightly externally rotates the leg. So that's the exact position that we're going to put it in because this is an indirect technique. So this lecture was a grab bag. We went over three big topics. We went over how you diagnose the lumbar vertebral segments. It's exactly the same as the thoracic vertebral segments. We went over the large muscle groups of the back in order to give an example of how to use myofascial technique. And we also went over the really important muscle of the psoas, including origin, insertion, dysfunction, and everybody's favorite, counterstrain. And that's OMM of the lumbar area. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Lymphatics]  
﻿When learning about the lymphatics, it's often easy to get weighed down with all the detail of where the system goes, what body part drains into what. But we're going to keep this very osteopathically focused and show you exactly what you need to know in order to get the question correct. There's a simple flow that you have to follow for every single patient every single time. So if you have a lymphatic question, go through this flow every single time and you'll get the question correct every single time. So to start off with, how does the lymph normally move throughout the lymphatic system? There are two big forces that help push the lymph throughout the lymphatic system. You can have smooth muscle contraction and compression. So imagine that you have fluid stasis in your lower extremities. When you're walking around, you're compressing the vessels in your lower extremities, and that's forcing the fluid to go back up throughout the rest of the system. When you're thinking about smooth muscle, imagine something as being squeezed at one end and it's forcing everything else in the same direction. That's the idea of what normal motion is. So what are you going to see in a patient who has some sort of abnormal motion? Oftentimes you're going to see some sort of fluid stasis. If you see a patient who has some sort of fluid stasis, you may want to consider treating the lymphatic system. Another patient that you might want to treat is one who has a mild infection. We're going to loop back around to mild infection at the end of the lecture. So what about some contraindications for treating the lymphatics? The main contraindications that you need to think about are fractures, cancer, mainly metastatic cancer, and severe infection. The general idea is that if a patient has one of these three things, you don't want to make the condition any worse by spreading it around by doing some sort of lymphatic technique. So what's the formula that I need to know in order to get these questions correct? So let's imagine that the waves of water represent some sort of fluid stasis somewhere in the body. The idea is that it gets stuck because of a choke point. The choke point is simply some sort of clog or choke in the lymphatic system. The choke makes it so that the rest of the lymphatic fluid cannot flow through that area, thus creating the choke point. There are numerous choke points throughout the body, and there are really five major ones that we're going to talk about. So why do these choke point even matter? The whole formula is that you have to treat the choke points in a certain order. You always follow the order, no matter what. You always start in one place, you end up in the last place. Never skip around in the order. So what are these choke points? The first one that you always want to treat first is the thoracic outlet. So theoretically, there can be many different things that cause a thoracic outlet choke point. Anything in the area can really do it. But two common ones that you can see are clavicle dysfunctions in ribs 1 and 2. If you have some sort of dysfunction in one of these two structures, then you may have a thoracic outlet choke. So how do you treat it? We've already talked about how you can treat these in previous lectures. So clavicle, you can treat the AC or the SC joint. In ribs 1 and 2, you can treat using an inhalation or exhalation treatment. The next choke point is going to be the diaphragm or the axilla. So what structure will cause a choke point at the diaphragm? The diaphragm. So when you're treating the diaphragm, how are you going to do it? You can dome the diaphragm, you can treat the attachment points at ribs 6 through 12, attachments points are L1 through L3, and xiphoid. We already talked about how you can treat ribs 6 through 12 and how you can treat L1 through L3, but we haven't talked about doming the diaphragm or the xiphoid. Just apply some of the concepts that you learned earlier in the lecture series. If you do a direct myofascial technique to the diaphragm, you can insert your fingers under the rib cage and push it where it does not want to go into the restrictive barrier. And the opposite for an indirect technique, push it into the freedom. So this is how you would treat the diaphragm, but what about the axilla? Just like for the thoracic outlet, anything that's up in the axillary region can cause a choke point in the area. But one common cause is pec minor. So if you want to assess the axilla for a choke point, assess pec minor. And if you want to treat it, apply some techniques that you learned earlier. You can either use muscle energy, you can use myofascial, whatever you feel like doing. The next choke point is going to be the hip. And what are some common dysfunctions that cause a hip choke point? You can have the psoas, the quads, and the innominates. We talked about how to treat these three structures in earlier lectures. If you are assessing for some sort of a hip choke point, check these three structures, and if they're dysfunctional, treat it and you'll treat the choke point. The next one down the list is going to be the posterior knee. So what can cause a choke point here? Think about some structures that attach to the posterior knee, like the hamstrings and the gastroc. If you want to treat the posterior knee, you can do it any way that you want to. You can do a direct myofascial technique and release the structures into the barrier, or you can push them into the freedom for an indirect technique. Muscle energy, engage the barrier, so on and so forth. Now what about the final choke point? The final choke point is going to be whatever the distal dysfunction is. And how are you going to treat it? You treat whatever the dysfunction is. So no matter what the dysfunction is, if you're treating the lymphatic system, you always have to follow the flow. You always start at the thoracic outlet. Then you move to the diaphragm or axilla, then you move to the hip, then you move to the posterior knee, and then you do the distal dysfunction. The only time that this changes is when you are assessing the thoracic outlet and they do not have a dysfunction in that area, you can skip it. You can't treat something that's not there. But if you skip it, you have to go to the next choke point down the list. So you have to go to the diaphragm or the axilla. Then you have to go to the hip. So what about diaphragm or axilla? If it's an upper extremity lymphatic issue and you're trying to treat the upper extremity, there's no real reason that you need to be treating the hip and the posterior knee. So you can treat the thoracic outlet, then go to the axilla, and then perform pump technique. So once that you've released all of the choke points in the very specific order that you have to go through every single time, you can then finish the treatment using a pump. There are a few different pumps that you can use in different situations. You have the pedal pump, which is also known as the Dalrymple pump. You can use the thoracic pump, which is also known as the Miller pump, or you can use extremity milking. So why would I use a different pump depending on which portion of the body I'm in? If you follow the example and the distal dysfunction is somewhere in the lower extremity, you'll want to do a pedal pump. Lower extremity, use the feet. And remember, this is a treatment where the patient is lying on their back, they have their feet out, and the doctor will push the feet forward quickly to get the fluid moving. If the lymphatic treatment that you're wanting to do is in the thoracic region, then you do the thoracic pump. If it's in the upper extremity, you can do extremity milking, where you just squeeze the upper arm to push the fluid in the direction. So now we're going to loop back to mild infections. If you have a patient who comes in with some sort of a common cold and you need to help move around some of the fluid in the sinuses, you can just do a facial sinus pump or effleurage. One treatment for otitis media would be the Galbreath maneuver. And remember, this is the technique where the physician grabs the angle of the mandible and pulls forward to help open up the Eustachian tube and get fluid moving. So in this lecture, we went over the order that you have to treat the lymphatic system in. No matter what the dysfunction is, you have to start at the thoracic outlet. If there is no dysfunction at the thoracic outlet, you can then move on to the next choke point down the list, which will be the diaphragm. No dysfunction, move down the list to the hip. No matter where it is, go through the list in the exact order. And then finish off your technique with one of the pumps. And that's OMM for lymphatics. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Posterior Chapman Points]  
﻿Here we go again with the Chapman's points. In the previous video we went over how to draw the anterior locations, but now we need to complete the set and talk about the posterior locations. This is going to be different than the anterior side, where the Chapman's points were located in the inter-rib spaces, on the posterior side they're located on the transverse processes. So, to start off we're going to draw our spine and our transverse processes and we're going to draw are spine down the middle. So, we're going to label all the lines that we went through C1, C2, T1, T2, all the way to T12. Then you move down to the lumbar spine. L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5. So, the first posterior Chapman's point is going to be on the transverse process of C1 and this point is going to represent your ear. The next point is on the transverse process of C2 and we're going to call this the ENT grab bag. It's going to include the nose, the sinus, the tonsils, the larynx and the pharynx. Next you move down to T2 transverse process on the posterior side and this is going to be your posterior Chapman's point for the heart. You can move down and draw two more red dots, which will represent your upper lung and your lower lung. Next, draw more red dots on T5, T6 and T7. Now remember you're looking at the body from the posterior side. So, the side that the stomach is going to be on is going to be on the left. So, this first point will be for your stomach acid. The second point is stomach motility and your third point is your spleen. So just keep it straight anatomically when you're looking on the posterior side these structures are on the left. If you move over to the right, these first two points are for your liver. You have a second point on the transverse process of T6 for your gallbladder and below that you have your pancreas. Next you can draw three more dots going down T8, T9 and T10. These are going to represent your posterior Chapman's point for your small intestines. So, we'll put a big S in a big I small intestine. So what about the large intestine? Large intestine is pretty unique. It covers the full area instead of just a point. It's going to be on the lateral sides of L2, L3 and L4 in a triangular shape. So, we'll draw a big L and then a big I for a large intestine and this will be bilaterally. So, L2, L3 and L4 large triangular shape going lateral. Next you need to draw the posterior Chapman point for the adrenal gland. We're going to make a triangle, because it looks like the cap of the kidney, then you can do the rest of the renal system by putting a dot on L1, L2 and L3. These are going to represent your kidney, your bladder and your urethra on both sides. So, your kidney, your bladder and your urethra. Next you have the weird GU Chapman's points on the posterior side. So, for this you're going to palpate out to the PSIS and here you're going to palpate the prostate, the vagina and the broad ligament. To finish it out, you need to put a posterior Chapman's point on the transverse processes of L5 for the uterus. Now location for the ovary is kind of tricky if you don't remember it. The way I remember it is the uterus is on L5, 5 x 2 is 10. So, the posterior Chapman's point for the ovary will be on T10. And finally, the last Chapman's Point. Don't forget it. It's for the appendix. It's going to be on the lateral side of T11. So here it is hanging off of T11. Don't forget the appendix. So, go home practice drawing this out a couple times, so that when it comes test day you can draw this out pretty quickly and get all the answers correct on where the posterior Chapman's points are located and that's OMM posterior Chapman's points. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Ribs]  
﻿When I was in school, one of my teachers told us that ribs are half the COMLEX. And while I may not agree with it being half of the questions on the COMLEX, there are definitely a large number of questions devoted specifically to ribs. So if you know how to get the correct diagnosis, then you can get the questions correct and it's some easy points. So to go over it, we're going to do some basic anatomy, some of the movements of the different ribs, the dysfunctions and how to treat them. So to start off with, we're going to go over the basic anatomy of the ribs. There are five landmarks on each rib that you're going to need to know. This is going to be the head, the neck, the tubercle, the angle and the shaft. And these landmarks are going to tell you if the rib is a typical rib or an atypical rib. So a typical rib has all five landmarks. It has a head, neck, tubercle, angle and a shaft. Ribs 3 through 10 are your typical ribs. So if you have typical ribs, you're going to have atypical ribs. An atypical rib either is missing a landmark or has an extra landmark. Rib 1 is atypical because it does not have an angle. Rib 2 is atypical because it has two tubercles. So rib 2, two tubercles. Ribs 11 and 12 are atypical because they do not have a tubercle or a neck. So you need to be able to classify ribs between typical and atypical. So there are three other classifications of ribs that you need to know. You need to know the difference between a true rib, a false rib and a floating rib. So a true rib as a rib that directly connects to the sternum. So we all know that all twelve ribs begin in the spine and the run all the way anteriorly to the sternum. The true ribs attach directly to the sternum. If we're going to draw this out, it'll look like this, where they attach to the sternum. The true ribs are ribs 1 through 7. Then you have the false ribs. They indirectly attach to the sternum. Their costal cartilage attaches to rib 7, which then attaches to the sternum. And this is ribs 8 through 10. And then you have what's called a floating rib. Floating rib does not connect to the sternum at all. So they're sitting all the way back at the spine without touching the sternum. The next thing that you need to learn is the motion of the ribs. Depending on which rib we're talking about, you're going to have a different type of motion. And there's three types of motion. You have pump handle, bucket handle and caliper. So we'll start off with pump handle. This is going to be ribs 1 through 5. So imagine an old-timey water pump, right? You have to pump the handle to get the water out. So relating that to the ribs, imagine that my elbow is the rib head back and the spine and my hand is the anterior portion of the rib. When I breathe in, the anterior portion will move upward, and when I breathe out, the anterior portion will move downward. So it's making this pump-like motion. So if I'm going to draw this as a picture, it will look something like this, where this is the rib, this is the sternum. During inhalation it moves up, and during exhalation it moves down. The next motion that we have is bucket handle, and this is ribs 6 through 10. So imagine that you have a water bucket. On the top it has that wire piece that goes back and forth. So relating that to the ribs, imagine that you're looking at ribs 6 through 10 and my arms are the ribs. When I breathe in, my ribs are going to go up into inhalation like this. And when I breathe out, they're going to swing back down into exhalation. So they move like a bucket handle, just like that. So if I'm going to draw this out, it'll look something like this, where this is the sternum, this is the rib, it moves up and it goes down. The final motion is caliper, and this'll be for ribs 11 through 12. So these ribs move a little bit differently. They don't attach to the sternum, so their motion is a little weird. So imagine that the ribs are attached to the back of the spine. When you breathe in, the ribs move outward, and when you breathe out, the ribs come back inward. This motion is called a caliper motion. So drawing this out, this is going to be the spine. Here's your caliper ribs, and now they move outward. So that's your caliper motion. So next we're going to talk about the muscles that you use during respiration. You can have primary muscles and secondary muscles. Your primary muscles of respiration are what you use when you're breathing when you're relaxed, and your secondary muscles are the muscles that you use when you need to get a little bit extra air in and out. So your primary muscles include your diaphragm and your intercostals. Important thing to note here is where the diaphragm attaches to the body. So the diaphragm attaches to ribs 6 through 12, L1 through L3, and the xiphoid. This is an important point for you to keep in mind. So if you're treating the diaphragm, you can do a direct technique where you're actively pushing underneath the ribcage to palpate the diaphragm, or you can treat one of these areas and technically you'll still be treating the diaphragm. You have your secondary muscles of respiration. You have your scalenes, you have pec minor, you have serratus anterior and you have your lats. So remember, you use your secondary muscles if you need to get a little bit more air in and a little bit more air out. Imagine when you're playing football, you got to breathe heavier. You're going to use your secondary muscles as well as your primary muscles. So what about rib dysfunction? So just like everywhere else in the body, everywhere throughout this course, you always name the dysfunction based off of what it can do. You're going to have two different types of dysfunctions. You can either have an inhaled dysfunction or an exhaled dysfunction. Inhaled meaning that the ribs can go into inhalation and exhaled means that the ribs can go into exhalation. So we'll start with inhaled. The ribs can go upwards into inhalation, and they cannot go downwards into exhalation. If you're going to treat this type of dysfunction, you use direct pressure. So when the patient is breathing in and the ribs are up, you would need to be the person that pushes the rib back down where it should go into exhalation. So the next type of dysfunction is exhaled. And it's going to be the opposite of inhaled. They cannot go up into inhalation, but they can go down into exhalation. So with an exhaled dysfunction, the ribs like to go down and they cannot get back up. The way that you treat these are going to be a little bit different than an inhaled dysfunction. For these, you're going to use muscle energy in order to pull the ribs back up into normal motion. And what muscles are you going to use? You're going to use the secondary muscles. So for rib number 1, you're going to use the anterior and middle scalene. For rib 2, you're going to use the posterior scalene. And then this is where the color coding helps us out. So ribs 3, 4 and 5 we're going to use pec minor. For 6, 7 and 8 we're going to use serratus anterior. And then for ribs 9 and 10, we're going to use the lats. Those are the muscles that you're going to use during your treatment. So how do you find the dysfunction in the first place? What you're going to do is you're going to ask the patient to lay on their back and you're going to palpate the ribs bilaterally as the patient breathes. When they go into inhalation, all the ribs should move upward into inhalation. When the patient exhales, all the ribs should go down into exhalation. As you're palpating both sides, you need to make a mental note of which way the ribs go. When the patient inhales and all the ribs move up, that's great. When the patient exhales, you notice that on the right side the ribs stay stuck into inhalation and they don't want to go into exhalation. So there's some sort of dysfunction over there. You always name it by what it can do, and since they can go into inhalation, that means it's an inhalation dysfunction. So the final part of this is talking about group dysfunctions. So one way to think about this is to compare it to an accordion. Everybody has an accordion at home that they play, right? So when you're playing the accordion, you go in and out. If one segment of that accordion doesn't work properly, it's going to jam up some of the other folds in the machine. So imagine the same thing for ribs. All of the ribs go upward and downward together, but if one of those ribs don't work properly, the group of ribs beside it is also going to become dysfunctional. That one rib that's causing the dysfunction for the group is called the key rib. How do you identify which rib is the key rib? We're going to use the BITE pneumonic. And the BITE pneumonic stands for bottom inhaled and top exhaled. So let's say you have a group inhalation dysfunction of ribs 5 through 7. Which rib is the key rib? Well, using the BITE pneumonic, you know it's the bottom rib, so it's rib number 7. If we're going to draw this out, it'll look something like this. So imagine that these are your palpatory findings. This group is the inhaled dysfunction and the bottom key rib is causing the rest of the ribs to stay stuck in inhalation. So this is your key rib. So this means that if you treat the key rib, the rest of the ribs will fall back into place as they should go. So remember, when the patient goes into inhalation, all of the ribs move up normally. This patient is now in exhalation. The bottom ribs went down normal, but because this key rib is stuck in inhalation, the top ribs cannot go downward normally. So you have to treat the key rib. Now let's do an exhalation dysfunction. Let's say that these are our palpatory findings for a patient during inhalation. The top ribs move normally into inhalation, they all move up. But because this key rib is dysfunctional, it's keeping the rest of the ribs below it in exhalation. So this means that you need to treat the key rib in order to get the rest of the ribs to move normally below it. And how are you going to treat this key rib? Well, it's an exhalation dysfunction, you go back to our exhalation treatments, figure out which rib it is, and then you're going to use that for muscle energy. So in this lecture we went over everything that you need to know about ribs. We talked about the anatomy and how you can divide the ribs into different groups, the typical motions, including pump, bucket and caliper, the primary and secondary muscles of respiration, how you name a dysfunction, and group dysfunctions. And that's OMM for ribs. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Rotator Cuff]  
﻿We're going to continue our discussion on the upper extremity by moving next to the sits muscles, or the muscles of the rotator cuff. We're not going to talk about the special tests, which you learned in anatomy and your MSK course, but instead we're going to talk about the function of the muscles and how we can relate this back to the treatment style and keep everything osteopathic focused. So what we're going to start off with is a picture of where the muscles are. So this is going to represent our scapula, and this is going to represent the humerus. I draw these to point out two important locations where the next three muscles are going to originate and insert. So the next three muscles all originate on the medial border of the scapula. All three of the next muscles will attach to the greater tubercle of the humerus. So we're going to go ahead and fill in our picture with the muscles, and the first muscle that we're going to start with, the supraspinatus. So the name of this muscle gives away where it's located. Supra, above, spinatus, spine of the scapula. So if we're going to draw it in, we're going to put it right here. Those are supraspinatus. The primary function of this muscle is AB duction, abduction. So what this muscle does is it abducts your arm. It pulls your arm away from the rest of your body, abduction. It's going to be innervated by the suprascapular nerve, and the nerve roots are going to be C5 and C6. The next muscle that we're going to talk about is the infraspinatus. This muscle name also tells you a little bit where it's about. Infra below, spinatus, spine. So below the spinal scapula, so we're going to put it right here. So what does this muscle do? This muscle, when it contracts, forces the arm to go into external rotation. So it will make the arm externally rotate outward. If my arm is already into AB duction, external rotation is going to look like this. So external rotation. So lucky for us, the nerve is easy to remember. It's the same nerve and it's also the same nerve roots. Super easy. The next muscle is teres minor. And the name doesn't help us with our location, but it's right below infraspinatus. Still originates at the medial border of the scapula and still attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus. The function, however, is going to be easy to remember. It does the same thing as infraspinatus, external rotation. The innervation is going to be a little bit different. It's going to be the axillary nerve, but the nerve roots are still going to be the same, C5 and C6. So we have the first three muscles down of the sits muscles. Now we have to finish with the fourth and final muscle. So to talk about this muscle, we're going to do another picture, except this time it's going to be from the anterior portion of the scapula. Previous pictures is the posterior side, this picture is the anterior side. This muscle is going to attach to a different location. It's going to be the lesser tubercle of the humerus, and it's going to originate in the subscapular fossa. This muscle is going to originate in the subscapular fossa and attach to the lesser tubercle from the anterior side. The name of this muscle is going to be subscapularis. So what does this muscle do? Well, we already have AB duction. The next two muscles did external rotation. Subscapularis does internal rotation. So if my arm is already out, internal rotation. My arm is flexed, this is internal rotation. So internal rotation. The nerve is going to be a little bit different. It's just the major and minor nerves to subscap. And the nerve roots are going to be the same except we add in an extra, C7. So to go over the muscles one more time, we have supraspinatus, AB duction, infraspinatus, external rotation, teres minor, more external rotation, and subscapularis, which is internal rotation. So sits muscles, S-I-T-S. AB duction, external rotation, external rotation, internal rotation. So now we're going to talk about dysfunctions and treatments for this muscle group. And what are we going to treat this with? Everybody's favorite, counterstrain. Now at this point in the video series, you should have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to be saying next. Counterstrain is an indirect technique. Put the muscle where it wants to go. Bring the origin and attachment closer together. Bring the origin and attachment closer together is just doing what the muscle typically does. So what position do you think that I'm going to put these muscles into to treat it with counterstrain? We already wrote them up all on the board. So this will be pretty quick. So for supraspinatus, we are going to put the muscle into AB duction, abduction, and if we put them there and we're going through the treatment position and the patient still says that the pain is not below a three out of ten like we want, we can modify it slightly. And the way that we're going to modify it is by adding external rotation and flexion. Just remember that the primary motion is going to be AB duction. The next one is infraspinatus. What does this muscle typically do? External rotation. So what are we going to put it in for counterstrain? External rotation. Again, if you're doing this treatment technique, you're still not getting the pain scale low enough to where you want it, then you can adjust with slight AB duction and slight flexion. The next muscle is going to be teres minor. And since it does the exact same motion as infraspinatus, you know it's going to be the exact same treatment position, infraspinatus. So when you're palpating these findings, where is the tender point going to be located? It's going to be located right where the muscle belly is. So when you're doing your palpations, if you feel a tender point on the superior side of the spine of the scapula, it's going to be supraspinatus. Infraspinatus, in the middle of the muscle belly, same with teres minor. So I say that to talk to you about subscapularis. Where am I going to feel that tender point since it's on the anterior side of the scapula? So what happens is the patient has their arm in AB duction and you're going to stick your finger in their armpit. There's a tiny bit of subscapularis that hangs out right here. If they have a tender point, this is where you're going to palpate it. So the final muscle is subscapularis. Counterstrain position, just like all the other ones, do what it likes to do. And what does it do? Internal rotation. And if this treatment position isn't getting the results that you want, you can add a slight bit of extension. Just remember that the primary motion is internal rotation. So this lecture's not too bad. It's the sits muscles, the muscles of the rotator cuff. Super highly tested, because these muscles are injured very frequently. So you need to remember what muscles do what motion, and how you would treat it with counterstrain. And that's OMM for the sits muscles. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sacral Diagnostics]  
﻿The sacrum is a topic that a lot of student have difficult with understanding, whether it's because there's tons of different motions, the diagnosis is difficult to make, whatever reason it is. But what we're going to do in this lecture is try and make it as simple as possible so you can get the questions correct on the exam. The first part of the lecture, we're going to talk about the motions that the sacrum goes through around what axis, and in the second part we're going to make a giant flow chart that will give you the diagnosis of the sacrum based on your findings. So we're going to start off with motions of the sacrum. So we're going to draw out the sacrum from the posterior side. So we're on the posterior side of the patient, we're looking towards the sacrum. This is going to be the base and this is going to be the apex. I drew it like this to make the angles very clear of where the sacral sulcus is and where the inferior lateral angle is. These two landmarks are going to be important when we start making our diagnosis. The next thing that you need to understand is how the sacrum moves. So imagine that I'm on the posterior side and this is the anterior side. My hand is going to be the sacrum. If the base of the sacrum moves anteriorly, this is considered sacral flexion. If the base of the sacrum moves posteriorly, this is considered sacral extension. So flexion forward, extension backward. This motion occurs around an axis. Now remember, from a previous lecture we had talked about an axis just being a linear point that something rotates around. So for the sacrum, you have one axis, sacrum is attached to it, flexed and extended around the axis. From a posterior side, flexed, extended around the axis. There are a few different axes, five in total, and you need to know what motion occurs at what axis. So to start off with, I'm going to talk about the midline axis. This axis is where postural motion occurs. So writing it out down here, midline is where postural motion occurs. So what do I mean by postural motion? When the patient is standing and he tips forward into flexion with his spine, the sacrum has to compensate. When you flex forward with your spine, the sacrum compensates by moving into extension around the midline axis. So it's opposite. So if you go into extension with your spine, your sacrum is going to move into flexion on the midline axis. So right now, if you flex the spine, you are going to extend the sacrum. If you extend the spine, you're going to flex the sacrum. So the next two axes that we're going to talk about are the oblique axes. There are two of them. There's a right oblique and a left oblique. The right oblique is named right because it goes through the right sacral sulcus. So right oblique. And the left oblique axis goes through the left sacral sulcus, left oblique. So writing that out, weight on left leg means that you're engaging the left oblique. And weight on right equals right oblique. The next axis that we're going to talk about is the superior axis. And there are two motions that occur around the superior axis. You have respiration and cranial. So how does this work during respiration? When you take a breath in and you inhale, the sacrum is going to go into slight extension. It's going to tip posteriorly into extension around the superior axis. So it's going to move like this, posteriorly. When you exhale, the sacrum is going to move in a flexion. The base will move anteriorly around the same axis. So writing that out, superior axis is for respiration and cranial. Inhale means that the sacrum will go into extension. And when you exhale, the sacrum goes into flexion. The other movement that occurs around the axis is cranial motion. So in this lecture, I'm just going to introduce the words, so just memorize the words for now, knowing that during a later lecture that's devoted 100 percent to cranial, we'll go over what everything means. So just remember what I'm writing down on the board. So for cranial, which is also called inherent sacral motion, when the SBS goes into flexion, your sacrum is going to go into extension. And when you're in the world of cranial, sacral extension is also called counternutation. When the SBS goes into extension, the sacrum is going to tip forward into flexion. And this motion in the world of cranial is called nutation. Don't worry about what these mean just yet. We have a lecture devoted all to cranial later in the series. So now that we understand how the sacrum moves, we're now going to go over how do you diagnose the sacrum? So you need three things in order to diagnose the sacrum. You need to know the seated flexion test. You need to know which side has a deep sacral sulcus, and you need to know which side is the posterior inferior ILA. So what do these three findings mean? The seated flexion test is when you have the patient seated on the edge of a chair or edge of a table. You have your thumbs hooked underneath the patient's PSIS, and then they bend forward in the flexion. As they go into flexion and you're monitoring with your thumbs, you take note of which thumb moves first, moves fastest or moves furthest. Whichever side that happens on is what side is dysfunctional for the sacrum. So it's telling you that that side of the sacrum is mobile. And this can either happen on the left side or on the right side. So seated flexion test, it's either positive on the left or positive on the right. Next you have the sacral sulcus. So what you do here is you have the patient laying on their stomach. You palpate the sacral sulcus and you tip your thumbs inward into the sulcus. And what you're doing is feeling for which sacral sulcus is deep and which sacral sulcus is shallow. So you can either have deep or you can have a shallow finding. It's important for you to understand that for the sacral sulcus, you can either have deep or shallow. In order to correctly diagnose the sacrum using our method later, you need to know which side is deep. So if you're given a finding that says that one side is shallow, you need to understand that they're saying that the other side is deep. So if the finding says the right side is shallow, that means that the left side is deep. So always take your findings and reinterpret them back into deep. Now posterior inferior ILA, you march your thumbs down to the ILA. You loop your fingers underneath and you palpate which side is posterior and inferior. For that, you can have two different findings. You can either have a posterior inferior side or you can have an anterior superior side. Just like the sacral sulcus, you need to understand that if you're given one of those findings, you can transfer it to the opposite side. So if they're saying that the right side is anterior and superior, this means that the left side is posterior inferior. And if you want to follow our diagnostic flow, you need to make sure that you're findings are posterior and inferior. So always change back to what findings you need for the dysfunction. So there are two different types of dysfunction that you can have for the sacrum. You can either have a flexion or extension dysfunction, or you can have a torsion dysfunction. So a flexion or extension dysfunction. That just means that the sacrum can flex or can extend. This can either be bilateral or it occurs on the right and the left side, so the entire sacrum tips forward or tips backward into extension, or this can be unilateral where only the right side tips forward or only the left side extends backward. So you can have a bilateral flexion or extension, or you can have a unilateral flexion or extension. Torsions are a little bit different. Torsions can flex around a certain axis or they can extend around a certain axis. The way that we say this to one another is by saying right on right or left on left or right on left or left on right. What this means is we are saying which direction the sacrum is rotated and on what axis it's rotated. You name the rotation based on which direction the sacrum is going. The axis that you're going to use to name the dysfunction is the oblique axis. So remember that you named the oblique axis based on which sacral sulcus you're running through. So right sacral sulcus, right oblique. Left sacral sulcus, left oblique. So there are two types of torsions. You can either have a flexed torsion or a forward torsion, or you can have an extension torsion or a backwards torsion. For flexed torsions, you can have a right on right or a left on left. If we go back to my pen example, let's say that my pen is a sacrum or my hand is a sacrum. If we use my pen as an axis that's oblique through the left side, it's going to run right here. If I'm going into forward rotation, it's going to go anteriorly. So it's going to move like this. You always name the direction of rotation based off which way the sacrum is going. The easiest way to think about this is imagine a set of eyeballs on the front side of the sacrum. When I bend forward around that left axis, my eyeballs are now looking to the left, so I'm rotated to the left. If I'm going into forward torsion around the right axis and I bend forward, my sacral eyeballs are now looking to the right, so it's a right torsion. So now the extension torsions, you can either have a right on left or a left on right. Unlike a flexed torsion, where the sacrum dips forward into flexion, for an extension torsion the sacrum dips backward into extension around that oblique axis. So if you're looking at it from the lateral side, it's going to look like this. If you look at it from the anterior side, it's going to rotate like this, back into extension. You can still name the directionality of rotation based on your sacral eyeballs. If you are rotating around the axis forward, you're rotating to the right. But for an extension dysfunction, if I'm going backwards my eyeballs are now looking to the left, so it's a left rotation. So looking at it from the forward side, going backward is a left rotation. So this next part of the lecture is going to tell you how you can interpret the diagnostic findings to tell you what the diagnosis is. This is outlined so that you don't necessarily have to understand what each finding means, but you just plug it into the flow chart and get the correct diagnosis. All that you have to remember is that it's a mirror and it's same/opposite, same/opposite, flexed, extended, right. You'll see what I mean as I'm going. So seated flexion test. You're going to have two findings. You can either have it positive on the left or positive on the right. And remember, since this is a mirror, we're only going to go over the left side right now. So the next thing that you do is you assess the side of the sacral sulcus and the ILA. Now remember, when you're interpreting the sacral sulcus findings and the ILA findings, you always want to put it into deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA. So if they tell you that one side is shallow, the other side is deep. Or if they tell you one side is anterior superior, the other side is posterior inferior. The next thing that you need to understand is that this can either happen on the right side or on the left side of the sacrum. So you have the findings of the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA on the same side. The deep and posterior inferior ILA are both on the same side. So same, or they can be on the opposite side. The next step that you need to run through is comparing the sacral sulcus in the seated flexion test. So you need to identify which side the sacral sulcus is deep on, and which side the seated flexion test is positive on. They can both either be on the right or on the left. For this side of the equation, if the seated flexion test is on the left and the deep sacral sulcus is also on the left, they're on the same side. If they're both on the same side, then you know you have a left unilateral flexion. If your deep sacral sulcus and positive seated flexion test are on the opposite sides, then that tells you that you have a left unilateral extension. If we move back up the flow chart to deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA occurring on opposite sides of one another, next we look at the deep sacral sulcus and the seated flexion test. If they are both on the same side, for example, the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the deep sacral sulcus is also deep on the left, they're telling you it's on the same side. If this happens, then you have a right on right. If they occur on opposite sides, meaning that the seated flexion test is positive on the left and the deep sacral sulcus is on the right, saying that they are on opposite sides, this tells you that you have a left on right dysfunction. So once again, same/opposite, same/opposite, same/opposite, flex, extended, right. Right because for both of these findings it's on a right oblique axis. And if the first one is right on right, the next one must be left on right. Now here's where the magic happens. I took you through every single step. I told you same/opposite, same/opposite. We went through all the findings. But for the chart, the way that we have it laid out, all you need to do is flip it like it's a big mirror, down the middle. So I can draw this out really quickly by saying seated flexion test's on the right, sacral sulcus reverse ILA, it's a mirror, so I can say this is opposite, this is same. Next we look at the sacral sulcus on the seated flexion test. Of both of these, we can have them being on the same side or the opposite. Because it's a mirror, it's going to be the opposite of the other side. And with our dysfunctions, we're just going to flip it. So we're going to start out with a right on left, then a left on left, then a right unilateral extension and a right unilateral flexion. So you can go through the entire flow chart based on left or right. There's a lot to memorize for the flow chart, and if you get frazzled in an exam, it may be difficult to remember everything. So in the next video, I'm going to show you the way that I do the diagnosis. How you draw it out, and once you understand how the motions are working, not only will you get the questions right on the test but you'll also understand what you're even talking about. So in this lecture, we went over axes of motion for the sacrum, what occurs around each axis, the three findings that you must have to get the sacral diagnosis, flexion and extension and torsion dysfunctions, and then went through the very confusion flow chart, which I made easy by saying same/opposite, same/opposite, same/opposite, flexion, extension, right oblique, right oblique, everything's a mirror. And that is how you diagnose the sacrum. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sacrum Practice and L5 Mechanics]  
﻿In the previous lecture, we discussed how to diagnose the sacrum using that massive flow chart. Same/opposite, flex extended, right axis, everything's a mirror, something like that. You didn't really know what everything meant, you just knew how to take the findings that you were given and run through the flow chart to get the diagnosis. This lecture is going to teach you how to be a good physician. It's going to tell you what the sacrum is actually doing and give you the correct diagnosis, and get you points on the exam, and make it so you don't have to memorize that massive chart. So the easiest way to do this is going to be to run through some practice questions. So you're still going to need the same three findings that you needed in the previous lecture. You need to know what side the seated flexion test is positive on, you need to know which side the deep sacral sulcus is on, and you need to know which side the ILA is posterior inferior on. You also need to remember that if they give you shallow for sacral sulcus, that means that the opposite side is deep. If they give you anterior superior for the ILA, that means that the opposite site is posterior inferior. Make sure that you know how to change both of those findings around to fit the mold. So the first set of questions are going to go over flexion and extension dysfunctions. So as a quick reminder, you can have a left unilateral flexion, a right unilateral flexion, a left unilateral extension and a right unilateral extension. If we're going to use the pen and hand method to show what these motions actually look like, it's going to look like this. So here's your axis. You have your sacrum and you're looking at it from the posterior side. A left unilateral flexion means that the left side of the sacrum is moving forward into flexion. So it'll look like this. A right unilateral flexion means that the right side goes forward. A left unilateral extension means that the left side comes backward into extension, and the right unilateral extension means that the right side comes backward into extension. So left flexion, right flexion, left extension, right extension. So let's do some practice questions. Let's say that you're in the clinic and you palpate on a patient, that they have a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, a deep sacral sulcus on the left, and posterior inferior ILA on the left. So the way that we're going to approach these questions is just to draw everything out. You're going to draw it out, it's going to show you what the sacrum is doing and it's going to give you the diagnosis. So here are your findings. The first thing that you're going to do is draw a sacrum. You're looking at the sacrum from the posterior side. The seated flexion test is positive on the left. The deep sacral sulcus is on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the left. The side that's positive for the seated flexion test is going to be the side of dysfunction. That means that every finding that you have on the left side will be dysfunctional or abnormal. The findings that you have on the right side are the normal findings, so where the sacrum should be. The next step is you can tell the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, posterior inferior ILA is also on the left, so it must be a flexion or extension. So we can draw our pen axis down the midline. So then, if we take our pen, take our hand, do the motions that we have written down, the left side is mobile because that's the positive seated flexion test, and the left side sacral sulcus is deep. So if we're going to do that, I have to push the left side forward into flexion. So this is going to be a left unilateral flexion. The left side is going forward into flexion. Left unilateral flexion. So I got that diagnosis without using the chart. I just drew it. Next question. So question number three, you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the right, the sacral sulcus that's deep on the left, and a posterior inferior ILA that's also on the left. So the first step is going to be to draw out the sacrum and draw your findings. So the seated flexion test is positive on the right. The deep sacral sulcus is on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is also on the left. The deep sacral sulcus and posterior inferior ILA on the same side, which tells you it must be a flexion or extension. So you can draw your vertical axis down the middle and figure out motion. So if we're going back to our pen and hand model, it's going to look like this. The right side seated flexion test is positive, so that's the mobile side, that's the abnormal side. That's the dysfunctional side. The left sacral sulcus is deeper than the right sacral sulcus. In order to make that happen, the right side must move backwards into extension. So in order to make the left side deeper, the right side move backward into extension. So that tells you that you have a right unilateral extension. So we got the correct diagnosis, still no chart. So let's say that the seated flexion test is positive on the right, the sacral sulcus is shallow on the right, and the posterior inferior ILA is located on the left. So the first thing that we're going to do is draw out the sacrum. So we're told that the seated flexion test is positive on the right. We're given that the sacral sulcus is shallow on the right. Remember that we need to transfer this finding to tell us which one is deep to follow our pattern. So if it's shallow on the right, that means that the left side is deep. Posterior inferior ILA on the left. So the deep sacral sulcus, posterior inferior ILA on the same side. We can draw our axis. Going back to the hand model, the seated flexion test is positive on the right, that's the abnormal side and that's the side with motion. So we are going to name the dysfunction based on which side is abnormal. So if the right side is mobile but the left side is deeper than the right sacral sulcus, then the right side must move back into extension. So the right side moves into extension, so we have another right unilateral extension. So one more question. We have a sacral sulcus that is deep on the right. We have a posterior inferior ILA that's positive on the right, and we have a spring test that's positive. So what's a spring test? A spring test is going to tell you if the dysfunction is an extension dysfunction or not an extension dysfunction. If your spring test is positive, that means that you have an extension dysfunction. So spring positive means that you have an extension dysfunction. A similar test to the spring test is called the sphinx test. It's similar in that if this test is positive, it's an extension dysfunction. If either of these tests is negative, that means it is not an extension dysfunction. So going back to our question, we're given three set of findings, so we just need to draw out a sacrum and figure out what it means. So we have a deep sacral sulcus on the right, a posterior inferior ILA on the right, and the sacral dysfunction is some sort of extension. So what do we do with this? Well, you know that the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA are on the exact same side, so it must be a flexion or extension. So if we're going to use our pen and hand model, we need to figure out how to make a dysfunction using those findings that gives us something that's in extension. So if the right side is deep, then we must make the left side shallow in order to give us an extension dysfunction. So this motion is a left unilateral extension. You name it a left unilateral extension because the left side was mobile. So now we're going to move on to torsions. So remember for torsions, you had two different types. You had a forward and a backward torsion. So you always name a torsion based on rotation and axis. And this is what's going to delineate between a forward torsion or a flex torsion and a backward torsion or an extension torsion. So for the flex torsions, you have a right on right and a left on left. For an extension torsion or a backwards torsion, you have a left on right and a right on left. Now if we're going to use our hand model to demonstrate what motion this goes into, we can use our pen axis and our hand as a sacrum. If we want to represent a left oblique axis, we need to make sure that the axis goes through the left sacral sulcus like this. If it goes into flexion, that means that the base of the sacrum is anterior, and the rest of the sacrum moves into flexion. This motion is a forward torsion. The base of the sacrum is moving forward. For an extension dysfunction, the sacrum is tipping backwards into extension. So it's coming back towards you or posteriorly. The way that you name the direction of rotation is which way the sacrum is going. Imagine that you have eyeballs on the anterior side of the sacrum, and when it does its rotation that's the way that the sacrum is looking. So in this example with a left oblique axis, if the sacrum moves forward in the flexion, the sacrum is now looking to the left, so it's rotated to the left. This is a forward torsion. If it goes backward into extension, the eyeballs are now looking to the right, so this is now a right on left dysfunction. This is a backward torsion. So forward torsion, left on left, backward torsion, right on left. So now some practice questions with this. So let's say that you had a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, sacral sulcus that's deep on the left and an ILA that's posterior inferior on the right. So what do we do? We're going to do the same thing. We're just going to draw it out. So we're going to draw our sacrum. We're given that the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the right. They're both on the opposite sides of one another, so that tells you it's some sort of torsion dysfunction. It also tells you that the left side is dysfunctional. The left side is mobile and you're going to name everything based off of that. So in order to make the left side mobile, that means that the axis that it rotates around must be through the opposite sacral sulcus. So the seated flexion test is positive on the left, the oblique axis runs through the right sacral sulcus. So at this point you can already fill in half of your diagnosis. You know it's something on a right oblique axis. Right oblique axis, right sacral sulcus. So now you just need to figure out which way the sacrum is rotated. So if you do a hand model, you have your oblique axis to the right, your sacrum is attached to it, the left sacral sulcus is deep. In order to make that happen, you have to dip forward into flexion. And when you go this direction, the eyeballs on the front of your sacrum are now looking to the right. So you have a right rotation on a right oblique axis. Right on right. Next question. So now you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the right. Sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, and a posterior inferior ILA on the left. So how we approach this? Draw it again. So we're going to draw our sacrum. Seated flexion test is positive on the right. You have a deep sacral sulcus on the right, posterior inferior ILA on the left. They're on opposite sides so you know it's some sort of torsion dysfunction, meaning that it must be an oblique axis. You know that the seated flexion test is positive on the right. This is the mobile side, this is the abnormal side. In order for this to be mobile, the oblique axis must run through the opposite sacral sulcus. So that means that the oblique axis will run through the left sacral sulcus. So you have half your diagnosis. It's something on a left oblique axis, left because left sacral sulcus. If we're going to use our hand model to go over what this is, we have a left oblique axis, sacrum goes on it, and in order to make the right side deep, you have to move forward into flexion. When I make this motion, the eyeballs on the front of my sacrum are now looking to the left, so I have a left on left dysfunction. Rotated left, left oblique axis. More questions. So let's say that you have a seated flexion test that's positive on the left, the sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, and an ILA that's anterior superior on the right. So what are you going to do? You're going to draw it out again. So you're given that the sacral sulcus is deep on the right. You're given that the seated flexion test is positive on the left, and you're given an anterior superior finding for an ILA. So remember, you have to be able to flip that over and tell which side is posterior inferior. So if it's anterior superior on the right, that means it's posterior inferior on the left. They're on opposite sides so you know it's a torsion, so it must have some oblique axis. The seated flexion test is positive on the left, telling you that the left side is dysfunctional and the left side is mobile. And for that to happen, the oblique axis must run through the opposite sacral sulcus. So you already have half the diagnosis. It's something on a right oblique axis. Right because it runs through the right sacral sulcus. If you're going to use a hand model, right oblique axis, sacrum going on it. And remember that the left side is mobile, so the left side is going to be doing the moving. In order to make the finding that the right sacral sulcus is deep, you must make the left sacral sulcus shallow. And in order to do that, you must tip backward into extension. When I tip backward into extension, the eyeballs on the front of my sacrum are now looking to the left, which means that you are rotated left on a right oblique axis. So this is an example of a backwards torsion or an extension torsion. So one more torsion example. Let's say that you have a sacral sulcus that's deep on the right, a posterior inferior ILA that's on the left, and you have a positive spring test. Approach this the exact same way as all the other ones. You draw out your sacrum. You draw on your findings. Deep sacral sulcus on the right, posterior inferior ILA on the left and a positive spring test, which means that it must be some sort of extension dysfunction. So you can put up here, extension dysfunction. So if you stop right here and think about it, it must be some sort of torsion because the deep sacral sulcus and the posterior inferior ILA are on the opposite sides. So the two backwards torsions that we know that go into extension are either a right on left or a left on right. In order to make a backwards torsion or an extension torsion, knowing that the right sacral sulcus is deep, we must make it so that we have an oblique axis on the right and make the left sacral sulcus tip backwards into extension. For us to do that, that means that we have a left on right. So if I'm going to draw that out, it goes into extension, this side is deep, that means this must be shallow, which means that the axis goes here, tips backward into extension. Eyeballs are looking to the left, so it's rotated left on a right oblique axis. So the next portion of this is where the test makers are going to try and have you relate the sacrum to L5. It's really not complicated. You just have to remember a few rules. So rule number one is that L5 flexion and extension occurs on the opposite direction of the sacrum. So if the sacrum is flexed, L5 must be extended. If the sacrum is extended, L5 must be flexed. Next we have rotation. The L5 directionality of rotation is going to be the opposite of the sacrum. So if the sacrum is rotated to the right, L5 must be rotated to the left. If L5 is rotated to the left, sacrum must be rotated to the right. And the final rule, L5 side bending tells you which oblique axis that the sacrum is on. So if L5 is side bent to the right, that tells you that the sacrum is on a right oblique axis. Side bent to the left, you're on a left oblique axis. Three rules, all you have to follow to tell you what L5 is doing in relation to the sacrum. So let's do some questions with it. Let's say that they tell you that L5 is neutral, side bent to the right and rotated to the left. So what do you do? They give you a neutral finding, but the rules are flexion and extension and are now lost. Use the other two rules and you'll still get the correct answer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw out my sacrum just like all the other questions. It's side bent to the right, which means that this is on a right oblique axis. So you already have half of your diagnosis. It's a blank on right. They also tell you that L5 is rotated to the left. Following the rule of L5 in rotation, the sacrum goes in the opposite direction. So if L5 is rotated to the left, that means that the sacrum must be rotated to the right. So your answer is a right rotation on a right oblique axis. Super simple. So final two examples. Let's say that they tell you that you have an L5 that is flexed, side bent to the left and rotated to the left. What's your sacral diagnosis? Draw it out, just like all the other ones. I'm going to draw my sacrum, side bent to the left so it must be a left oblique axis, so blank on left. Rotated to the left, which means that the sacrum must be rotated to the right, so it's a right on left. You can go through these pretty quickly. Right rotation on a left oblique axis. Now the final question. You're going to have to interpret two different findings to get the correct answer. So let's say that they tell you that the seated flexion test is positive on the right, the sacral sulcus is deep on the left, and the posterior inferior ILA is on the right. What are your L5 findings? So now you got to go backwards. You have to diagnose the sacrum first, then use your sacral rules to find out what L5 is doing. So the first thing that I'm going to do is figure out what the sacral diagnosis is. I'm going to do that by drawing my sacrum. Seated flexion test is positive on the right, sacral sulcus is deep on the left, posterior inferior ILA is on the right. They're on opposite sides so it must be some sort of a torsion dysfunction. And the mobile side is on the right. The dysfunctional side is on the right, which means that the axis must be through the left sacral sulcus. So far, you know the diagnosis is a blank on left because it's a left oblique axis. To make this work, you need to have your left oblique axis, sacrum going forward, the left sacral sulcus is deep, the right side is mobile, so you must move the right side to make it shallow, which means you're tipping backwards into extension. And now your eyeballs are rotated to the right. So you know that you have a right rotation on a left oblique axis. So now you know what the diagnosis of the sacrum is, you got to relate it back to L5. So you use the exact same rules. So you know that L5 is something, side bent in some direction, and rotated in some direction. Side bending occurs on the exact same plane as your axis, so whatever the oblique axis is, is your side bending component for L5. Left oblique axis, it must be left side bending. The other rule is that L5 is rotated the opposite direction of the sacrum. We know that the sacrum is rotated to the right, which means that L5 must be rotated to the left. Now we know that flexion extension occurs in the opposite direction of the sacrum. So if you remember that a right on left torsion is a backwards torsion or an extension torsion, that means that L5 must be flexed. So the answer to this question is L5 flexed, side bent left, rotated left. So we went through a bunch of practice questions to get the answers correct for sacral diagnosis. And in none of these questions did I use that chart that I may or may not remember. So follow this, be able to draw it out, know what the diagnosis is, and you'll be in good shape for the exam and in your clinic as well. And that's my method for diagnosing the sacrum. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Scoliosis and Leg Length v2]  
﻿This lecture is going to be devoted to scoliosis, leg length discrepancies and how the body is going to compensate for these pathologies. Now don't get lost in the weeds trying to figure out how exactly to calculate the Cobb angle and what the rules of bracings are. Don't worry about that for now. We're going to keep this very osteopathic centered. So, to start off with there are two different types of scoliotic curves. You can either have a dextroscoliosis or you can have a levoscoliosis. So, what's the difference? The difference is going to be the directionality that the spine takes. So, for dextroscoliosis it'll look something like this. Dextroscoliosis curves to the right. The convex side is on the right side. One way to remember that this is a dextro curve is it kind of looks like a D when you look at it from the posterior side. So dextro is convex to the right. Levo is going to be the opposite. Levo is convex to the left. Left levo, convex to the left. So, you can have different severities of your scoliosis. You can have a mild scoliosis. You can have a moderate scoliosis, or you can have a severe scoliosis. So how are we going to tell the difference between the scoliotic curves? What's the delineation between mild, moderate and severe? It's going to be the angularity that the spine takes. So, in order to get the angle, you need to calculate the Cobb angle. We're not really going to discuss how exactly you calculate this, but just know that you take the bottom of the spine and compare it to the top of the spine in terms of curve and you're going to calculate the angle. The worst the curve, the higher the angle, the more severe the disease. So, for mild scoliosis, you'll have a Cobb angle between 5 and 15. For moderate, you'll have between 20 and 45 and for severe it'll be an angle above 50. Now if you have a severe enough scoliosis to have an angle above 50, you need to worry about respiratory issues for your patient. And if it's so severe where it's over 75, you need to start worrying about cardiac issues. So, what can you do to help treat your patient with scoliosis? It depends on the severity. For a mild scoliotic curve, you can attempt to use OMM. For moderate, you can begin by using on them, but you really need to start thinking about bracing. And for severe, you definitely need to start thinking about surgery. So there are two different classes of scoliotic curves. You can either have a functional curve, or you can have a structural curve. Now what's the difference between functional and structural? A functional curve when the patient begins to flex, extend, side bend, rotate in some direction the scoliotic curve will not be present anymore. This is called functional. So, when the patient moves it goes away, so away with movement. Structural is going to be the exact opposite. So, no matter what they do, they're always going to have that curve. So, it's just the opposite. No matter which way they move, they're going to keep the curve. So, we mentioned treating using OMM, what exactly are we going to be treating? Well, of course, you're going to look at the spine, but here's the big topic of this lecture, compensation patterns. So the body is always going to try and compensate in order to keep the patient as upright as possible. If the patient has a curve in one direction, it's going to have to compensate by maybe moving the hips, moving the neck, moving the shoulders to keep the patient straight and because of that, they can develop somatic dysfunctions throughout their entire body all because they have a scoliotic curve. So as a visual representation, so as you can see in this artist demonstration, the scoliotic curve will be curved in one direction and the rest of the body will need to compensate by maybe side bending the head, maybe side bending the shoulders as well. It can also move around the innominates in the sacrum as well as the lower extremities. So as you can see the body will compensate in different directions. So, when you're treating the patient who has scoliosis, don't only look at their spine, look at the rest of the body for potential compensation pattern. So, when you're treating, of course, you look at the spine, you can also look at the neck, shoulders, the innominates, the sacrum, the PSOAS and the lower extremity, just to name a few. This isn't a complete list, but just some of the heavy hitters. So now we're going to move our discussion over to leg length discrepancies. So, you can have two different types of leg length discrepancies, two different types of short leg. You can have acquired, and you can have congenital. So, acquired and congenital. So what's the difference? Acquired means that at birth both of your leg lengths are the exact same. So at birth you don't have a short leg. At some point during your life, you're going to develop a somatic dysfunction that causes you to have a short leg. So, you have some sort of issue that causes it. So, some sort of a problem causes the short leg. What could some of these problems be? In some of the previous lessons we already talked about some causes of short leg, but as a reminder you can have a posterior innominate rotation in up-shear of the innominates or a PSOAS dysfunction. So, if you have a patient and you screen them and they have a short leg and you have these findings on your screen that's telling you that a somatic dysfunction is causing their short leg. This is going to be different than congenital. A congenital short leg means that you were born with one leg shorter than the other. So, in congenital you're born with a short leg and because of this you're going to have some problems moving forward. So, if you're born with a short leg the body is going to have to compensate, just like it did for scoliosis. It's going to do what it can to keep the body as straight as possible that can either be attempting to elongate the leg or it could be moving your body into a certain way so that you stay as straight as possible. So, some of these findings that can be a compensatory pattern towards a congenital short leg would be an anterior innominate rotation or a down-shear with your innominates. So, if you see a patient who has a congenital short leg, which you would know from their history or from their chart. These are the findings that you would see, because the body is compensating. Other findings that you can have for a compensated congenital short leg would be an inferior sacral base on the side of the short leg and your lumbar spine may be convex on the side of the short leg. Remember the body is going to try and compensate to keep you as straight as possible. Now here's the key to this. There's a difference on your findings between acquired and congenital. If you have an acquired short leg, these are the findings that are going to cause it and what you'll see on the screen. Congenital is someone born with the short leg. These are the findings that you're going to see on the screen as compensation. So, keep these two separate. Now if they have a congenital short leg, you can treat that using heel lifts. So, when you use a heel lift, your heel if is going to be 1/8th of an inch and you are going to increase by 1/8th of an inch every two weeks. So, the reason that you don't give it all back at once is because the body compensation patterns. The body is a big tensegrity unit. If you treat the leg length discrepancy all at once, then you're going to throw off the rest of the body with all the other compensation patterns. Now you can use 1/8th heel lift for a normal young healthy patient, but if they are elderly you need to start at 1/16th heel lift and increase by 1/16th every two weeks. So, imagine as granny is not as spry as the college kid, so you can't be treating granny the same way that you treat a young person. So, the way that you're going to treat elderly is go low and even slower. Now if they have some sort of trauma, you can give it all back at once. Now what do I mean by trauma? The patient had surgery or if they're in a motor vehicle collision and all of a sudden they come out of it with a short leg, because they're missing part of their tibia or part of their femur, you're allowed to give all of that leg length back at once. That's because there has been no time for the body to compensate. It's been too short of an interval between the damage and the rest of the compensation. So you can give it all back at once to avoid compensation patterns. So, in this lecture we went over scoliotic curves and how to name them based on directionality. We went over the severity scales, how to treat it. Different compensation patterns that you can see, and we also went over leg length discrepancies. Make sure that you keep straight acquired versus congenital and your structural findings. That is the OMM for scoliosis and leg length discrepancies. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Scoliosis and Leg Length]  
﻿This lecture is going to be devoted to scoliosis and leg length discrepancies. And you can really get lost in the weeds by trying to learn how to calculate the Cobb angle and figure out the exact reasons for why one leg is longer than the other, and yada yada yada. We're going to keep this focused on what you need to know for the osteopathic side of things and how you can help your patients if they have scoliosis or some leg length discrepancy. So we're going to start off with naming scoliotic curves. There are two scoliotic curves that you can have. If it's convex to the right, this will be a dextroscoliosis. This is also the most common kind of scoliosis. If it's convex to the left, it's a levoscoliosis. Left, levo. So what does this look like? If I'm going to draw out a dextroscoliosis, your vertebra will look something like this. Maybe not as intense of a curve, but something like this. The convex side is the curvy side. We have it pointing to the right, so this is a dextroscoliosis. If it were pointing to the left, it would be levo. One way that you can tell that this is dextroscoliosis, if you can't remember convex and what direction, this kind of looks like a D from the posterior side. So what about the severity of scoliotic curves? So there are three different classifications that you need to know. You can have mild, you can have moderate, and you can have severe. So how do we calculate these different severities? How do we know? Well, it's going to be the angle of the curve. And how we're going to calculate that is by using the Cobb angle. We're not going to go over the exact mechanism how to calculate the Cobb angle, just remember that you take the angle of the top of the curve and the bottom of the curve and this is going to give you the angle of severity. So on our chart, a mild severity angle will be 5 to 15 degrees. Moderate severity will be 20 to 45, and severe will be greater than 50. If you have a curve of greater than 50, you need to start worrying about respiratory issues. And if someone has a very severe curve above 75 degrees, you need to start thinking about cardiac issues. So what are we going to do to treat these dysfunctions? It's going to change depending on the severity. So if you have a mild scoliotic curve, you can treat it with OMM. So what exactly am I treating? You can be treating the spine for flexion, extension, side bending and rotation dysfunctions. What about for moderate? Well, moderate you can use OMM, but you also need to start thinking about bracing. Not going to go into the details about bracing, just know that as you move down the scale, you need to start doing more treatments than just OMM alone. Once you get down to the severe category, this is when you start needing to think about surgery. You can also have two different types of curves. You can have a functional scoliotic curve and a structural scoliotic curve. For functional, this means that as the patient is moving their spine, as they start to rotate, side bend, and even flex and extend throughout normal motion, the curve seems to go away. So as they curve towards the lesion or towards the curve, then the curve will start to be less noticeable. This is known as a functional scoliotic curve. So away with motion. So you can also have what's called a structural scoliosis. This is basically the opposite of functional, where it doesn't go away no matter how the patient moves. So doesn't go away. So bringing this back to an osteopathic focus, what about treatment for the patient? Well, if you're going to treat with OMM, you certainly need to look at the spine. But then here's where the main concept of this lecture comes in. You need to understand something about compensation. Now the body always wants to try and stand up as straight as possible. But if the patient has a curve in one direction, the body doesn't want them to be walking around with a curve, it wants to compensate so that they can try and stay as straight as possible. This compensation pattern is going to cause numerous dysfunctions throughout the body. It's going to look something like this, where imagine the patient has a scoliotic curve, but the rest of the body is going to need to compensate in order to stand up straight. So the innominates will have to move around. The lower extremities will have to move around. Even the shoulders might have to move around. So with this artist's rendering of common compensation patterns, you can see that because the curve is in one direction, the shoulders are going to have to compensate in the other, the neck is going to have to compensate in another direction, the pelvis is going to have to compensate, and even the lower extremity will have to compensate. This is all to make the body stand up as straight as possible. The primary points that you can think about are going to be your innominates and your shoulders. The big deal that you need to understand is that they cannot compensate in the same direction. If they compensate in the same direction, the patient won't be able to stand up straight. So you see if the spine is to the right, the shoulders are going to have to compensate to the left, while the innominates are going to compensate the opposite direction from the shoulders by going to the right. So the compensatory pattern is opposite going up and down the body. So when you're performing your OMM treatments, you need to be looking at different portions of the body in order to treat the entire patient. So not only do you need to be looking at the spine, you can also look at the neck, shoulders, the psoas, innominates, the sacrum, and the lower extremity. So you need to treat the entire patient, so you need to look at all of the common compensatory areas in order to do so. So shifting gears from scoliosis, we're going to talk about leg length discrepancies. So imagine that you have a patient who comes in whose one leg may be a little bit longer than the other, or one leg's a little bit shorter than the other. Their whole body is going to have to compensate in order to keep everything upright. So the same idea is going to hold true as in scoliosis. The body still needs to compensate, but the cause is different. Instead of scoliosis, it's going to be a leg length discrepancy. So you can have two different types of leg length causes. You can have congenital, which someone is born with, or you can have acquired. So what are some examples of acquired leg length discrepancies? Think back to some of the lower extremity and pelvis lectures that we talked about, and you can think of some of the reasons that would cause some discrepancies. Some causes of a short leg can be a posterior innominate rotation. So remember, for a posterior rotation, the pelvis is rotated posteriorly and it's going to pull all of the bones of the lower extremity up, and that's going to cause a short leg. Now imagine an up shear. You have a pelvic up shear, one of the innominates are moving up, which is then going to pull all of the bones of the lower extremity up with it, thus causing a short leg. And finally, psoas. If the psoas is hypertonic and it's causing flexion, side bending and rotation towards one side, the rest of the body is going to need to compensate, and to do that it's going to pull this leg upward and you're going to have a short leg on that side. So what about some causes for long leg? As you can imagine, they're probably going to be the opposite of short leg. So you can have an anterior innominate rotation. Remember, when you rotate anteriorly, the bones of the lower extremity will be pushed downward. And you can have a down shear. When the innominate is pushed downward, it will push the rest of the bones of the lower extremity downward, thus causing a long leg. So how about treatment? The first thing that you can look at doing is OMM. If it's some sort of acquired discrepancy, you can just treat the dysfunction like we went over in previous lectures. You know how to treat innominate rotations and you know how to treat shears. You also know how to treat the psoas. So just do that and you can potentially treat the leg length discrepancy. But if that doesn't work, you want to start thinking about heel lifts. Now as we discussed earlier, if the patient has a short leg, the rest of the body is going to compensate for that. You're going to have compensatory patterns throughout the body. When you're treating with a heel lift, you can't just give everything back all at once, because the rest of the body is still compensated. So even if you fix the leg length discrepancy, they're still going to have pelvic dysfunctions, shoulder dysfunctions, neck dysfunctions, everything. So you need to start slow and work your way forward. So you start out with a one-eighth inch heel lift. You increase this by one-eighth of an inch every two weeks. This is a little bit different for elderly individuals. For elderly, you're going to start with a one-sixteenth inch heel lift. Now think about it this way. Granny is not as spry as a college kid, so the body compensatory patterns will take a little bit longer to adjust to changes. So if you give them one-eighth of an inch heel lift, the rest of the body may not catch up as quickly as someone in college. So start even lower and go even slower. So you'll start out with a one-sixteenth heel left and you'll do the same, where you increase every two weeks. Now this is different for trauma cases. So in this example, by trauma I really mean fracture. Let's say if the patient has a femoral fracture, he has to go into the operating room and have it repaired. When he comes out, he now has some sort of leg length discrepancy after the repair. If that's the case, the body has not had time to compensate and you can give them their entire discrepancy back in a shoe lift. This is okay because since the rest of the body has not had time to compensate, if you start out slow and work you way slowly up, the body will have to compensate. But if you just give them their entire discrepancy all at once, then the body will remain normal as it has been. So in this lecture we went over scoliotic curves, the different severity types, really had to focus on different compensatory patterns and common areas that you can find compensation, and then we went over leg length discrepancies and shoe lifts. And that's OMM for scoliosis and leg length. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Sequenced Structural Exam]  
﻿At this point you have many bits and pieces of osteopathy floating around your brain. You know how to diagnose the sacrum, screen for Chapman's points and even figure out something with the autonomics, but what you don't know is how to put all of these pieces together for your patient on the PE and in the clinic. You simply don't have enough time to perform every assessment on every patient. Here we're going to discuss a screening tool that you can use on every patient every time that can then help you dial in on the area of dysfunction and then you can rapidly screen and treat. So, the name of this exam is called the Sequenced Structural Exam. In some schools this is called the style screen named after the creator Dr. Styles. There are two portions of this exam. You start off with screening the spine. Now when you screen the spine, you're going to do this on every patient every time. this is the tier 1 portion of this screen. Tier 1 because you do it on every patient every time. When you perform the spinal screen, it's then going to give you an idea of which areas of the body are dysfunctional. When you know which areas of the body are dysfunctional, you can then perform a focused exam on that area, which will be your Tier 2 screen. So, the second step is your focused exam, which will be your Tier 2 exam. So, you're going to perform the spinal screen on every patient every time that's going to give you an area of dysfunction, then you can perform your focus Tier 2 exam on that specific area. So, what exactly are you looking for? The Tier 1 screen is going to identify areas of restriction. The areas of restriction are then going to tell you which portions of the body are dysfunctional. You're going to perform the exam from the occiput all the way down to the SI joint. Whichever area is dysfunctional could potentially tell you the areas of the body that you need to do a focused exam on. So, what are the mechanics of how the screen works? It's type 3 mechanics. If you recall back from one of the early lessons, we discussed Fryette's three laws. The third law discussed stacking and it said that the further that you move into one plane of motion, like flexion the less you can move into side bending and even less you can move into rotation. We're going to use this idea during our spinal screen to assess for areas of dysfunction. We're going to use both hands to perform this stacking exam. One hand, we're going to call the director and the other hand we're going to call the lever. Now don't get too tripped up on the names of the hands. They just help you remember what the hand does. So, the director hand is going to induce two planes of motion, the flexion and the side bending component. The lever hand is going to induce the rotational component. So, you put both of them together to get all three planes of motion. We're going to flex forward side bend to one side and then rotate to that exact same side thus stacking all of your motions. So, your director hand is going to flex and side bend toward whatever side that you're going to be screening and the lever hand is going to rotate towards the side of side bending. So, if you're drawing this out, the director hand is going to flex and side bend to the right. The lever hand is going to push laterally on the spinous processes to induce rotation towards the same side of side bending. So how exactly are you going to perform this exam? You're going to screen the patient from the occiput to the SI joint bilaterally. So, you can start on the left or you can start on the right. We are going to perform the stacking with the patient first standing and then in a seated position. This entire Tier 1 portion of the screen shouldn't take more than 30 seconds, but it's the most important step. It gives you where the areas of dysfunction are. So after you perform the standing and seated portion, so once that you performed the exam with the patient standing and then with the patient seated, you need to assess if the areas of restriction are still in the same locations, if the patient is standing or if the patient is seated. So, is it the same? If it is the same, the next step is going to be to assess the location. There are three different locations that you can find these areas of restriction. It can either be above C7 or at C7. It can be somewhere in the thoracic spine or it can be at or below L1. If it's at or above C7, this is telling you that you have a cervical dysfunction. So just to catch up, you've done your Tier 1 screening exam. You've assessed the patient's spine. Now you know that the area of greatest restriction is in the cervical spine. This now tells you that you can perform your focused Tier 2 exam in the cervical spine. So, some of those exams that you can perform are to assess for cranial motion. Look at the OA at the AA and look at C2 through C7. Now if the location was somewhere in the T-spine, this tells you that you have a thoracic dysfunction. Now it's not as easy for a thoracic dysfunction as it is for cervical. You now need to assess the patterns that you palpated the areas of restriction. So, the next step is to assess the patterns. So, the area of great restriction patterns. There are three different patterns that you can palpate in the thoracic spine. The first pattern will be when you're palpating the spine in the thoracic area, at one vertebral segment bilaterally you feel a dysfunctional area. So, as you flex side bend and rotate the patient as you're palpating, you feel an area of restriction on both sides of the spine. This area of restriction is worse at the spine but gets better the further that you move lateral. This is going to tell you that you have a vertebral dysfunction. So, you've now performed your Tier 1 exam of the spine. You now know that the area of greatest restriction is in the T-spine, you now know that it is in a vertebral segment. Now you can perform your focused Tier 2 exam and for that we already went over in some of the previous lessons to diagnose a vertebral segment of T-spine, you just assess for flexion and extension, side bending and rotation. Another area of great restriction pattern that you can palpate is it going to be the opposite of vertebra. When you palpate the spine at one vertebral segment on both sides, you're going to notice the area of restriction gets worse the further lateral that you move. If you palpate this, this is telling you that you have a rib dysfunction and remember from the previous lessons, you already know how to diagnose and treat the ribs. So, you'll have the patient inhale and exhale and monitor for rib motion. Don't forget that if it's a group dysfunction remember the BITE mnemonic to find the key rib. Now there's a third pattern that you can palpate in a thoracic spine. When you palpate the spine, you're going to feel a unilateral band that extends multiple vertebral segments. If you palpate this finding, it's going to tell you that you have an upper extremity dysfunction. So now you can perform your Tier 2 focused exams on the upper extremity. This can include screening the scapula, the SC joint, the AC joint, the shoulder, the radial head, the wrist and the hand. Basically, use your screening tools for something in the upper extremity. Now that you've performed your Tier 1 exam, you know that your Tier 2 exam should be somewhere in the upper extremity, you don't have to waste time looking at the patient's lower extremity. Now if your area of restriction is at or below L1, this is telling you that you have a lower body dysfunction. If the area of restriction is at or below your L1, it's a lower body dysfunction or if your areas of restriction were different when the patient was standing and seated. So, when you perform the Tier 1 exam when the patient is standing wherever the area of greatest restriction is, you just make note of it. When they are seated and you perform the Tier 1 exam again, if that location is different that automatically tells you that it is some sort of lower dysfunction. So, if it's a lower dysfunction the next step is to assess if the AGR is at the SI joint or not. If the area of greatest restriction is at the SI joint, this tells you that you have some sort of SI dysfunction. Now what two structures have already gone over that articulate at the SI joint, the innominates and the sacrum and you already know how to screen for both of these dysfunctions. So, remember for the innominates you perform a standing flexion test and to screen the sacrum you perform a seated flexion test. Now if the area of greatest restriction isn't at the SI joint, but is still somewhere in the lower body, that means that you have a lumbar dysfunction. Now just like the thoracic spine, you're going to have some different area of great restriction patterns that you need to be able to interpret in the lumbar spine. So, in the lumbar spine, there are two different AGR patterns that you need to remember. In this first pattern when you're palpating the lumbar spine, you feel an area of restriction bilaterally in the same vertebral segment. If you feel this that means you have a vertebral dysfunction. Now remember from the lumbar lesson the diagnostic exam is the exact same as a thoracic spine. So, you're going to assess for flexion extension, side bending and rotation. The second AGR pattern that you can notice when screening the spine is that unilaterally you feel a band that extends multiple vertebral segments. If you palpate this, this is telling you that you have a lower extremity dysfunction. There are many dysfunctions in the lower extremity that you know how to screen already, some of them include the knee, the fibular head, a tibial rotation, an ankle dysfunction or something down in the foot. So, over this lesson we've talked about how you can perform a Tier 1 screening exam on every patient every time just by looking at the spine. This Tier 1 shouldn't take more than 30 seconds. Once that you do that, it'll give you areas of restriction that you can then note the patterns of and perform your focused Tier 2 exams to figure out which area is dysfunctional and how to best treat your patient. This will help you a lot in the PE when you're crunched for time and you still need to screen your patient, but this can also be very beneficial in the clinic as well and that's OMM: Sequenced Structural Exam. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Shoulder]  
﻿We're now going to begin our talks about the upper extremity and some of the dysfunctions you can find there. We have this divided into three separate lectures, and this will be the first one. We're going to talk about dysfunctions of the shoulder area. So we're going to include the AC joint, the SC joint, the scapula in general and adhesive capsulitis. So we're going to go ahead and start off with the AC joint. Now the AC joint is the acromioclavicular joint. So this is where the clavicle on the lateral side attaches to the acromion. So clavicle to the acromion. What does this joint do? This joint really helps move the scapula around and keep all the structures in the area stable. If the AC joint is dysfunctional, then you're going to have some sort of immobility or some sort of instability in the area. You may even notice this in the scapula region, which is what we're going to use as our diagnostic finding. So keep stable and level scapula. So how do we make our diagnosis? You're going to do what's called a spring test or a compression test. It's where you're going to place your hands over the patient's AC joint and you're going to spring downward. And you're also going to compress. You're going to do this on both sides and you're going to assess which joint is dysfunctional. You're going to tell that by which joint has a hard in feel, which joint just isn't moving properly when you're springing or when you're compressing. That tells you which side is dysfunctional. So to diagnose, do the spring or the compression test to tell dysfunction. Let's say you have that, the next thing you're going to have to do is measure the spines of the scapula. So you're going to go around to the posterior side of the patient and you're going to take both of your thumbs and measure which spine of the scapula is where. For a dysfunction, one of the spines of the scapula may be elevated and one may be depressed. You always name it based on the dysfunctional side. So in this example, let's say that you had a right dysfunctional AC joint, and you notice that the right scapula is higher than the left. That means that you have a right superior AC joint dysfunction. So the next step is to measure the scapular spine. So what do we do about treating this? It's actually pretty simple. Both treatments are exactly the same as one another, there's just a slight tweak if it's inferior or superior. What you do is you're going to perform a muscle energy technique. You're going to have the patient seated and you're going to ask them to AB duct their arm all the way out. The physician is going to go behind the patient, place his knee on the table underneath the arm, so that the patient cannot push his arm downward. During the muscle energy treatment, the patient's isometric force will be pulling his arm down towards the table. He won't be able to go down towards the table because the physician's knee is in the way. To further engage the barrier, the patient is going to raise his arm up while the physician lifts his knee up higher. The treatment difference is all about where the hand is. If it's a superior dysfunction, you have the patient supinate their hand. If it's an inferior dysfunction, you have the patient pronate their hand. So you can remember superior supinate, or if the scapula is elevated, you put the palm up. So to write that out, we have superior dysfunction, you're going to supinate the hand and the patient is going to try and pull his arm down towards the table. If it's an inferior dysfunction, you're going to have the patient pronate his hand but you're still going to have him try and pull his arm down. So this is how you perform the muscle energy technique to treat the AC joint. Superior, inferior. So next we move over to the SC joint. So the SC joint is the sternoclavicular joint. It's where the sternum and the clavicle attach. You can palpate this area by this notch right at the top of your sternum, and you have one on both sides. So the SC joint is where the sternum connects with the clavicle. Now what does this joint do? It really helps keep everything stable as you're moving your upper extremity. When you're shrugging your shoulders, the joint will move inferiorly. When you're moving your shoulders forward, the joint will accommodate by moving posteriorly. So we're going to assess this joint by its motions. So one of the primary motions is the SC joint moves downward when shrugging shoulders. So it moves downward in relation to the rest of the anatomy of the upper extremity. When I shrug, the lateral side of the shoulder is up while the SC joint is located down. So what happens when it's dysfunctional? We use some of the concepts that we talked about from the earlier lectures. Dysfunctional is just abnormal motion of anatomy. So if the normal motion is moving downward when shrugging your shoulders, the dysfunction will be it will not be able to move like this. We're going to use this to get our diagnosis. So what we do is we go behind the patient, we palpate the SC joint bilaterally, and we have the patient shrug their shoulders. We then assess which joint doesn't move properly. Once we've figured out which one doesn't move properly, that's the side of dysfunction. The next thing that we do is we measure the height of the SC joint. So we can place our fingers on both sides bilaterally and tell which SC joint is superior and which one is inferior. You always name it off of the dysfunctional side. So if the right side is dysfunctional, and when you measure it's lower down, that means that you have a right inferior SC joint. So the second step is to measure your SC joint. So how do we treat this? So we're also going to treat this with muscle energy, but it's not going to be as easy as the AC joint. There are two completely different techniques that you need to do. So for a superior SC dysfunction, you're going to use subclavius during your muscle energy technique. So how are you going to engage this muscle? What barrier are you going to put the patient into? You're going to have the patient seated and you're going to have them move their arm backward into extension. Their isometric force will be trying to punch forward. The physician will be holding the patient's wrist and making sure that they cannot punch forward. When you're engaging the barrier, you go further into extension with the arm. So arm back is the barrier, and punching forward is the isometric force that you have the patient do. So that's how you treat the superior SC joint. Now we're going to talk about inferior. If the SC joint is inferior, you're going to use the sternocleidomastoid muscle, so the SCM. The idea of using this muscle is that it's attached to the SC joint, and when you engage it, it's going to help pull the SC joint back up where it should be. So what's the treatment position for this? You're going to engage the barrier by having the patient rotate away from the side of dysfunction. So if the SC joint is inferior on the right, the patient's going to rotate to the left. His isometric force is going to be side bending towards the side of dysfunction. The physician is going to hold the patient's head still as he tries to move into side bending towards. That causes the isometric force. So the barrier is rotate away, and the force is going to be side bend toward. Now remember, after every single technique, whether it's muscle energy or myofascial or anything else, you always have to reassess for treatment efficacy. So after the treatment, reassess by palpating the SC joint when shrugging the shoulders. The next part of this lecture we're going to talk about the scapula. The scapula is the massive bone on the posterior side of your shoulder region. Scapula can move in many different directions. It can elevate, it can depress, it can go into protraction moving forward, it can come into retraction when moving backward. So really it just moves everywhere. So what are we going to see in a dysfunction? Well, the patient will have an abnormal function of anatomy. So it won't be moving properly when the patient is doing something with his upper extremity. That's how you're going to get the diagnosis, lack of movement. So how do you treat it? You can really do just about anything to treat this if you're doing a myofascial technique. You just have to remember whether you want to do a direct technique or an indirect technique. So remember, if you're doing a direct technique for myofascial, you push the scapula where it does not want to go. You're engaging the barrier of the scapula. And if you're doing an indirect technique, you want to push it towards the freedom, where you push it where it can go. So we're going to wrap this up with adhesive capsulitis. So adhesive capsulitis is just a fancy way of saying a frozen shoulder. So when you have frozen shoulder, you're going to have restriction in some sort of movement plane of your shoulder, whether it be flexion, extension, AB duction, AD duction, whatever. The way that you're going to treat this is exactly the same, no matter what the dysfunction is. This is where you're going to use the seven stages of Spencer. So if you remember from your time at school, the seven stages of Spencer is kind of difficult to remember. So there's some pneumonics that go around from school to school. One school uses something about an ice cream cone that I don't know, but the pneumonic that I use and also happens to go pretty well for online med ed, is every fine cat takes an indoor piss. Every fine cat takes an indoor piss. So what does that mean? For this treatment, it's muscle energy. You need to engage different barriers throughout your treatment. So each of these letters represents a different barrier that you're going to engage during treatment. So the first barrier is the extension. Then you move into flexion, then you do compression with circumduction. The next step is traction with circumduction. Then you move into AB duction, abduction, then AD duction with external rotation. The next step is going to be internal rotation, and the final step is going to be the pump. So kind of difficult to remember. Just pick a pneumonic and stick with it. So how is this likely going to show up on an exam question? They're not necessarily going to ask you to diagnose adhesive capsulitis because it's so easy, but the question may say, what are you going to use to treat it? Answer, seven stages of Spencer. The question could say that they're going through the seven stages of Spencer, they've already done internal rotation, what's the next step? You got to remember the steps, and the answer is pump. So just remember the pneumonic, you'll get the question right. You can probably use this to treat some patients, too. So this is the end of the first lecture of the shoulder area. We went over the AC joint, the SC joint, the scapula, and the seven stages of Spencer for adhesive capsulitis. And that's OMM of the shoulder region. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Thoracic Spine Diagnosis]  
﻿As an osteopath, one of the first things that you learn is how to diagnose a thoracic spine. Not only is this important for the clinic and for your exams, but this also lays the foundation for everything else in the rest of this course. So to start off with, we're going to go over some very basic landmark anatomy to make the diagnosis. And the first thing that you need to understand is where the three important landmarks are. You have the body, you have the transverse process and you have the spinous process. So this is what it'll look like from a lateral view, and if you're looking from the top down you're going to see something like this, where this is the body, this is the transverse process, and this is the spinous process. It's important to know where these three are, because the body tells you which direction the vertebral segment is rotated, the transverse process is what you palpate to assess for rotation, and the spinous process is what you palpate to tell which vertebral segment you are at. So the next thing that you need to understand is the rule of threes. And the rule of threes are a set of guidelines that tell you where you are in the spinal column. Each spinous process comes out at a different angle, depending on what level of the spine you are at. So for T1, 2 and 3, the spinous process comes out directly posterior or directly horizontal. So it's at the same level that the vertebral body is. It's at the same level as the transverse process. So if you're looking at it from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this. The spinous process is going to be on the same level as the transverse process. So as you move further down the spine to T4, 5, and 6, the spinous processes are going to come out at a little bit of an angle. They're going to go down half of the level. So if you're looking at this from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this, where the spinous process comes out half of a level below the vertebral body. So this is important because if I'm trying to palpate the transverse process of T5, I need to find the spinous process, march my fingers up half of a level and then palpate horizontally to find the transverse processes. So the next three, T7, 8 and 9, come out one full level below. So they're going to look like this. If you're looking at it from the posterior side, you're going to see something like this, where the spinous process goes down one full segment. So if I'm palpating the spinous process of T8 and I move my thumbs horizontally, I'm going to be palpating the transverse processes of T9. If you need to palpate the transverse process of T8, you need to find the spinous process, move up one full level, and then go horizontally. On exam questions, they may say you palpate the spinous process of T8 and then to the sides of it you palpate the transverse processes, they're telling you that this is T9. So for the last three, you take the other rule of threes and you flip it. So for T10, it follows the same rules as T7 through 9. For T11, it follows the same rules as T4 through 6, and for T12, it follows the same rules as 1 through 3. So now that you know which vertebral segment you're at, you need to be able to name a dysfunction. And there are three components that go into naming a dysfunction. You have the flexion and extension component, you have the rotation, and you also have the side bending. So for an example diagnosis, let's say that you have T6 and it is flexed, rotated right and side bent to the right. So remember, you always name the dysfunction by what it can do. So this says that T6 can flex normally, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. So for each plane of motion, you can have only certain movements. So you can have either a flexed, extended or neutral dysfunction. Rotation you can either have a right rotation or a left rotation, and for side bending you can either be side bent to the right or side bent to the left. So now once you know the motion, now you need to find out how to make the diagnosis. So the first thing that you do is assess for rotation in neutral. So how do I assess for rotation? So what you're going to do is you're going to take your thumbs and you are going to come to the posterior side and you're going to palpate the transverse process of each vertebral segment. Depending on how deep your thumbs go in will tell you what direction the spine is rotated. So if both thumbs are level, that means that that vertebral body is not rotated. If your left thumb goes in deeper, that means that you're rotated to the right. And if your right thumb goes in deeper, that means that you're rotated to the left. So drawing it out, if you have a right rotation it's going to look something like this. And now when I'm palpating the transverse processes, my right thumb doesn't go in very far but my left thumb goes in pretty deep. So this tells me that it's rotated to the right. The way that you name the rotation is which direction the vertebral body is looking. So the vertebral body is looking to the anterior side to the right. So this tells you it is a right rotation. So once you have the rotation component, the next thing that you need to do is assess for rotation during flexion. And when you do this there are two outcomes that you can have. It can either get better in flexion, meaning that when you're palpating in flexion the rotation goes away, or both of your thumbs are now even, or the rotational component doesn't get any better or gets worse. Remember, you have to name it by what it can do. So if the segment gets better in flexion, it can go into flexion, that means that it's a flex dysfunction. Now if it doesn't get better in flexion, the next thing that you're going to need to do is assess during extension. So you're going to do the same thing. You're going to ask the patient to puff their chest out, extend to the vertebral level, and you're going to assess for rotation on the transverse process. Two things can happen here. It can either get better during extension, meaning that the rotational component during extension goes away and both of your thumbs are even, or it can get worse or not change during extension. Once again, if it gets better during extension, that means that it can do extension. So that means that you have some sort of extended dysfunction. If it doesn't get better during flexion and it doesn't get better during extension, that means that you have a neutral dysfunction. In real life, you're going to have to assess for rotation and flexion extension maybe a few times to be able to really tell if it's better during flexion or better during extension. On the exam, they're just going to tell you it gets better during flexion, it gets worse during extension, so you can figure out if it's a flex or extended dysfunction. So now that you have two components of flexion and extension or neutral and rotation, the final thing that you need to do to make the diagnosis is assess for side bending. And the way that we're going to do that is by using Fryette's laws. Now Fryette's laws are a set of rules that tell you which direction the vertebral segment is side bent during flexion, extension or neutral. So type 1 says that during neutral, rotation and side bending occur in opposite directions. So one easy way to remember this is if you draw your N, you put arrows on both sides, they're going in opposite directions. So side bending in rotation occur in opposite directions. Type 2 tells you about flexion and extension. This rule says that during rotation and side bending of a flexed or extended dysfunction, they both occur in the same direction. Easy way to remember this is to put arrows on your letters. So they're all going in the same direction, meaning that if it's a flexed or extended dysfunction, rotation and side bending both occur in the same direction. Now there is a third rule, and it's about stacking. It doesn't necessarily help you with making the diagnosis, but it is important to know. What this says is that during the three planes of motion, flexion, extension, side bending, rotation, the range of motion that you go in one direction will limit the range of motion in the other three. So the more that I flex forward, the less I'm going to be able to rotate and the less I'm going to be able to side bend. So stacking. Not very useful to make the dysfunctional diagnosis, but so important to know. So now that you know the side bending component using Fryette's laws, the rotational component and the flex sticks under the neutral component, you now have your diagnosis. And the easiest way to go over this is to go through some practice questions. So let's say you're taking the exam and it says that in neutral, you palpate that the patient is rotated to the left. It gets better in flexion, meaning that your fingers become more level during flexion. It gets worse in extension, and it doesn't really tell you anything about side bending. So what's the diagnosis? So you know that it gets better in flexion, and if you go through the flow chart, you know that it must be a flex dysfunction. So let's say this is T6 flexed, they told you that it is rotated to the left, so rotated to the left, and using Fryette's second law for a flexion dysfunction, that tells you that rotation and side bending are in the same direction. So you know that it's rotated left, which means that this is also side bent to the left. So another practice question. Let's say that they tell you during neutral you're rotated to the left. The rotational segment doesn't get better during flexion and does not get better during extension. And they also don't tell you what the side bending is doing. So what's the diagnosis? So let's say we're at T6 again. They give you that it's rotated in neutral to the left. So if we start here, it doesn't get better during flexion or extension, so we know it's a neutral dysfunction. So you can write down neutral. Using Fryette's first law, neutral dysfunction, rotation and side bending are in opposite directions. They tell you that you're rotated to the left, so you can do rotated left, side bent to the right. And that'll be your diagnosis for that. Next question. Let's say that they don't tell you anything about rotation, but they do tell you about side bending and they say you're side bent to the right. They say that it gets better during extension and gets worse during flexion. So what's the diagnosis? So this question shows that really, you can flip this flow chart backwards if you need to. If you're given side bending and not rotation, you can still run through the flow chart. You can also still use Fryette's laws and work backwards. So if it's a neutral dysfunction, side bending and rotation are still opposite. So for this dysfunction, let's say it's T6 again, side bending to the right that gets better in extension. So it's an extended dysfunction. Since it's an extended dysfunction, we can follow Fryette's second law saying that rotation and side bending are in the same direction. And we know that it's side bent to the right. So we're rotated to the right and side bent to the right. So for the last practice question, let's say that they tell you during neutral you're rotated to the right. They don't tell you anything about flexion and they don't tell you anything about extension. But they tell you that side bending occurs to the left. So what do you do? So it doesn't get better in flexion or extension, so you know it must be a neutral dysfunction. You can double check yourself because rotation and side bending occur in different directions, which is a Type 1 mechanic rule. So T6 neutral, rotated to the right and side bent to the left. So during this lecture we went over how to palpate the landmarks that are important for your diagnostic findings, the rule of threes that tells you where you are in the spinal column, as well as the relation of the spinous process and transverse process, how to name a thoracic diagnosis, Fryette's laws of how to find side bending, whether it's a neutral, flex or extended dysfunction, your diagnostic flow chart, and a couple of practice questions. And that's how you diagnose the thoracic spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Thoracic Spine Facet Model]  
﻿In the previous video, we talked about how to diagnose the thoracic spine using palpatory findings of the transverse process. In this video, we're going to talk about how to diagnose the thoracic spine using the facet model. In real life, there's really no difference to use either the facet model or the transverse process model. There's no difference. In real life, it's really just up to what you feel more comfortable with, using the transverse process or using the facets. But on an exam, you're still going to be held accountable for knowing what each finding means for both models. So we're going to go through the facet model here. So the first thing that you need to understand is where the facets are. So the facets are bony articulations between each level of the vertebrae. So if you have vertebra number 1 and vertebra number 2, where they touch is where the facets are, and that's how they move on one another. If you're making the palpation, they're located between the spinous process and the transverse process. So if you're going to draw this out, it's going to look something like this, where this is the transverse process, spinous process in the middle, the facets are going to be located right here. So when you're doing your palpation, you can palpate the spinous process, move up a little and horizontal, and you're now at the facets. So the next thing that you need to know is how the facets are oriented to one another. It changes depending on what level of the spine you're at. So if you are in the cervical spine, the facets are oriented backwards, upwards and medial. This orientation tells you a little bit of how the motion at each joint will work. When you move down to the thoracic, the facets are oriented backwards, upwards and lateral. And when you move down to the lumbar spine, the facets are oriented backward and medial. So BUM, BUL and BM. Easy way to remember it, bumblebee. BUM BUL BM. Bumblebee M. On an exam they can ask you something as simple as, which way are the facets oriented in thoracic spine? The answer would be backwards, upwards, lateral. So how do I make the diagnosis using the facets? So if I'm palpating the facets in neutral, there's no extra movement. When I ask the patient to go into flexion, two things are going to happen. The facets will open and your thumbs will move cephalad. Cephalad just means toward the head, so they move upward. So if you draw this out, it's going to look something like this. The space between the facets will open and get larger, and your thumbs will move cephalad or towards the head. During extension, it's going to be backwards. When you're palpating during extension, the facets will close and your thumbs will move caudad. Caudad is a fancy way to say down or towards the feet. My teacher when I was in school, he had a really southern accent, and when he said caudad, it sounded like he was saying crawdad. So if you think of crawdad and the legs, caudad, legs, down. So if you're going to draw this out, during extension the joint space is going to get squished closed, and your thumbs will move downward. Squished closed, thumbs down, during extension. So how do you use these findings to tell you what the diagnosis is? So what you're going to do is palpate during neutral, during flexion and during extension, just like you did when you were using the transverse process. For the dysfunction, one of the facets may not open or close correctly, and that's going to tell you everything that you need to know. So if I'm going to draw this as a picture, let's say that we ask the patient to flex forward. On the right side, the facet opens normally and my thumb goes upward towards the head. But on the left side, my thumbs stay exactly the same. They stay where they were. This tells you that the left facet is dysfunctional and it's causing a left side bending in rotation. So if you pretend that my thumb and pinkie are the transverse processes, it is now going to the left. So side bend and rotated to the left. This is your findings during flexion. Now during extension, it's going to be a little backwards. So you ask the patient to extend back. On the left side, the joint space squishes closed and your thumb still goes down towards the feet like normal. But on the right side, nothing happens. Your thumb doesn't move properly. This tells you that the right side is dysfunctional. So the vertebral segments look the same during flexion and extension dysfunctions, but you have to understand that on the left side is a dysfunction for a flex and on the right side that's the dysfunctional facet for an extended. So let's do some practice questions over it. So let's say you're taking an exam and it tells you that during flexion, both thumbs move cephalad, and during extension, the right thumb goes down towards the feet but the left thumb stays immobile. So what's the dysfunction? The way that I like to do it is I draw this out. So during flexion, both thumbs move in the cephalad. So it will look something like this. Both facets open normally like they should. During extension, the right thumb moves downward towards the feet, and the left thumb stays immobile. So the right facet squishes closed like it should, but the left facet stays open. This is telling you that the left facet is dysfunctional during extension. So if you're using this to make the diagnosis, let's say that we're at T6, everything gets better during flexion. Remember, you always name a dysfunction by what it can do. So better in flexion means that it's a flex dysfunction. And if you look at our facet picture, you can tell that it is now rotated and side bent to the right because of the facet orientation. So you can put down that you are rotated right and side bent to the right. You can even use Fryette's laws to double check yourself if you need to. You know that since it's a flex dysfunction and using the second law, rotation and side bend occur in the same direction. So rotated right, side bent right. So for number two, let's say that in flexion, the right thumb moves upward like it normally should, but the left side stays immobile. And during extension, both thumbs move down normally. So what's the diagnosis? So we're going to do what we just did, we're going to draw it out. So during extension, we know that both thumbs move normally. So both facet spaces get squished closed and your thumbs move down normally. So now we're going to draw during flexion, so the right thumb moves upward as it normally should, but the left side stays closed, which is dysfunctional. Because of this dysfunctional facet, you can now see that the vertebral body is rotated and side bent to the left. It's really important to draw these out as you're going so you don't get tripped up by which facet is dysfunctional and which one isn't, and which thumb moves whatever way and which thumb goes where. If you draw it out, it makes it extremely easy so that you can get the points correct on the test. So draw it out every time. Use your hand model if you need to. This facet's dysfunctional, this one's normal, your thumb and pinkie move this way. So it's side bent and rotated to the left. So to write out the dysfunction, we're going to put T6, it gets better during extension, so it's an extended dysfunction. It's going to be rotated to the left and side bent to the left. So left thumb is immobile and your right thumb goes upward. So now the third example. So they can tell you which directions your thumb moves, but they can also tell you which facets open and close. So you need to be able to interpret that as well. So let's say that during flexion, both facets open normally. But during extension, the right facet closes but the left facet stays immobile. So we're going to stick with the theme of drawing it to make sure that we get the question correct. So during flexion, both facets open normally. When we look at extension, the right facet squishes closed but the left facet does not close normally. So the dysfunctional segment is on the left, but you're still rotated and side bent to the right. So very important just to draw this out every time. So for our diagnosis, we're going to say T6 again, everything is normally moving in flexion, so it's a flex dysfunction, and during our picture we saw that we are rotated and side bent to the right. So the FRS right. So right closes normally, the left is immobile, and both facets open during flexion. So in this lecture, we went over where exactly the facets are, how they move during flexion and extension, the orientation of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Just remember bumblebee M, and then three practice questions to go over how to make the correct diagnosis. And that's how you use the facet model to diagnosis the thoracic spine. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Tips for the COMATs]  
﻿At the end of each rotation, you're going to have to take a standardized exam. In the DO world these are called COMATs. The exam is going to go over everything that you were supposed to have learned over that rotation, but there's also going to be an OMM component. Of course, it's a good idea to just know everything, but each COMAT it may be a good idea to get really deep into specific osteopathic topics. So, to start off with we'll start with Pediatrics. Now in Pediatrics the cranial bones aren't exactly fused just yet, that occurs a little bit later in life. So, it may be a good idea to take another look at the cranial lecture, so that you understand all of the different cranial diagnosis and the motions of the cranial bones. This can really come into play when we start talking about the cranial nerves. If there's a cranial dysfunction, it's possible that that can lead to a cranial nerve impairment, which you may be able to see in one of your pediatric patients. So, without getting too deep and going over all of the cranial nerves again, here's a simple way to draw out some of the functions of the cranial nerves. So, if you can see it kind of looks like a face, so one -- cranial nerve one helps with smelling and this is located where the nose would be. Two, three, four and six around the eyes, five the whole face, seven the whole head, eight for hearing, 11 for your accessory nerve helping out the muscles of the neck and then you have three more. You have cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12. These are written in red because specifically for Pediatrics if there's some sort of an impairment of cranial nerve nine, 10 and or 12, you may see trouble feeding and latching in newborns. So, if you see a patient with feeding and latching issues as a newborn, they may be trying to get you to think about cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12 impairment. Now there is a specific combination between cranial nerves and possible cranial bones that are dysfunctional. There's a nice chart that we have in the notes that goes over everything, but in reality the cranial nerves overlap with a lot of different bones. Some of the bones that you need to be aware of is going to be the temporal bone, occipital and the sphenoid. It will be important for you to be able to match up a cranial nerve impairment dysfunction based off of the findings and then be able to figure out which cranial bone you may want to target your treatment towards, because there's such an overlap it's going to be really difficult for exam writers to figure out a good combination. So more than likely they're going to give you an impairment of a nerve with a combination of a bone to treat, but if you're ever super stuck and in doubt most cranial nerves can be treated by treating the temporal bone. So, if you're ever super stuck pick temporal. The next COMAT is going to be the psych COMAT. Now on the psych COMAT what sort of patient may you see? Someone with depression or anxiety. So, if a patient has depression, it's been shown that osteopathically they'll have a decreased cranial rhythm and they will have shallow and short breaths. So imagine this, a depressed patient can come in, cranial rhythmic impulse is going to be depressed. They may be hunched over, slouching, taking short rapid breaths. One thing that the exam writers may be trying to get you to think of is assessing for cranial function. So, if you see a depressed patient with a decreased CRI, make the connection that they're wanting you to assess cranial function. If you see the patient has difficulty breathing with shallow or short breaths, you should immediately think of respiration. So, make the connection here that a depressed patient with depressed breathing, they may have a respiratory dysfunction. Remember back to the ribs lecture where we talked about how to diagnose the ribs, dysfunctional sacrum, dysfunctional SCM. If you see that presentation make the connection and think of those topics specifically. The next COMAT is going to be surgery. Common patient that you're going to have on the surgery COMAT is a post-operative patient. There are three presentations that you would need to be aware of. Post-op atelectasis, wound healing and post-operative ileus. When you take the surgery COMAT, you're probably going to see a patient that has some of this. You need to be making some osteopathic thoughts about patients with these dysfunctions. So, if you see a presentation for post-op atelectasis, they're trying to get you to think about respiration again. You need to try and prevent post-op atelectasis. You can do that by improving their breathing, treat the ribs, treat the diaphragm, treat the SCM, potentially perform rib bracing. Go back to the ribs lecture if you want a more in-depth review. So once again respiration. Now wound healing. You need to be able to promote wound healing throughout the entire body for the patient. What you're going to have to do to promote wound healing is treat the lymphatic system. If you need a better refresher on lymphatics, go back to the lymphatics video. So, if you see wound healing think about treating the lymphatics. This means treat the choke points and perform some pumps, get the fluid moving again. Now post-operative ileus. They're trying to get you to think of the autonomic nervous system and patient facilitation. So, when you see the word atelectasis think of facilitation, think of excess sympathetic flow to the intestines. So post-op ileus, think of autonomic nervous system. Now the levels that you should pay particular attention to are T5 through T9 and T10 and T11. So, these two autonomic levels are where the majority of the organs in the abdomen are going to be located and where the majority of your general surgery questions will come from. If you need a better in-depth review of the autonomic nervous system, go back to the autonomic lesson. So, some Chapman's points that you'll definitely see on your surgery COMAT. You should be aware of the liver, the gallbladder, pancreas, the kidney and the appendix. You have Chapman's points on the anterior side and the posterior side. For the liver, these Chapman's points are located on the fifth and sixth rib interspaces on the right side of the body. On the posterior side, these are located on the fifth and sixth transverse processes on the right side. The gallbladder is located in the sixth interspace on the right side. On the posterior side, it's T6 on the right transverse process. For the pancreas, it's the seventh rib interspace on the right and on the posterior side, it's T7 transverse process on the right. For the kidney, this is the location that's one inch lateral and one inch superior to the umbilicus on the anterior side and on the posterior side it's on L1 transverse process bilaterally. Don't forget the appendix on the anterior side, it's on the tip of rib 12 on the right and on the posterior side it's on the lateral portion of rib 11 on the right. Now moving to the OB COMAT. Now on the OB COMAT it's safe to say that you're going to have some patients who are moms, who are pregnant, or maybe are new mothers, so moms. The patient presentation that you may see would be lower back pain and potentially some sort of autonomic facilitation. So autonomic nervous system facilitation. Now if you see this presentation, the exam writers might be trying to get you to think about the sacrum. So, the sacrum is going to move to compensate for pregnancy. When you're pregnant, the sacrum will bilaterally extend in order to compensate needed the extra room. Once that you've given birth, the sacrum will by laterally flex forward. So, when pregnant, bilaterally extended sacrum. After birth, the mom may have a bilaterally flexed sacrum. Now this motion of the sacrum is normal, but if it stays in these locations for an extended period of time, it can become dysfunctional and if it's dysfunctional that can lead to lower back pain and potentially some autonomic facilitation. If you need a refresher on the sacrum, take a look at the sacrum lesson. If you need a refresher on autonomics, take a look at the on anomic lesson. So, if you have a pregnant patient or a new mom who has lower back pain or autonomic facilitation, think of the sacrum. So, if you're thinking autonomics some important levels to remember are T10 through T11 for the gonads and T12 through L2 for the rest of the sex organs. Now to finish this up with some Chapman's points that you will probably see on the COMAT, you should know the Chapman's point for the uterus, the ovary, the vagina and the broad ligament. You should know the anterior Chapman's point and the posterior Chapman's point. For the uterus, the anterior Chapman's point is on the IT band and on the posterior side, it's the transverse process of L5 bilaterally. For the ovary, the anterior Chapman's point is on the pubic tubercle and on the posterior side it's the transverse process of T10 bilaterally. For the vagina the anterior side, it's on the IT band and the posterior side it's on the PSIS. For the broad ligament the anterior side is the IT band and posterior side is the PSIS. Now it may be possible that you would see a newborn on your OB exam. If you do just remember the cranial nerve findings. So, what about the internal exam and family and the OMM COMAT? For these COMATs, it's probably a good idea just to know everything. If you've made it this far into the lessons, you should have a pretty good understanding of osteopathy and the core concepts so that you can be prepared to answer any question that you see whether it's something that you've already studied or maybe something new that's going to require a little bit of understanding of core concepts for you to work out the correct answer. So, on the IE and family and OMM COMATs, it's a good idea to just know everything. Obviously, this isn't an all-inclusive list of what OMM things you may see on each COMAT, but this is a pretty good starting point for you. On Pediatrics, it's a good idea to take a look at the cranial nerves and cranial dysfunctions, noting that cranial nerve nine, 10 and 12 will affect feeding and latching. For the psych exam may be a good idea to look at cranial and respiration. For surgery, you want to avoid post-operative complications by looking at respirations, lymphatics and autonomic nervous system. For OB make sure that you take a look at that sacrum and for IE and family and OMM, you should probably just know everything and that's OMM for the specialties. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Tips for the PE]  
﻿The dreaded PE. I'm sure just talking about it is inducing stress in you right now. You have to see a certain number of patients in a short amount of time and oh yeah, as a DO student you need to bring in OMM and treat your patients using osteopathic techniques. As an OMM teaching fellow one of my roles was to take students who have previously failed the PE and help them pass on their next attempt. Now I'm going to give you my tips and tricks on how you can pass the PE and look forward to the OMM sections as easy points on test day. So, the first thing that you need to know is communication and there are two people that you need to communicate with on your exam day. The first one is the patient. Now if you have an osteopathic patient who's there to be seen for an osteopathic reason, they may try and tip you off by saying I heard your DO tell me about that, or maybe they'll say I had a friend who is treated with OMT. What is it? Can it help me? You need to be able to anticipate this question and come up with a quick elevator speech to give a quick demonstration of what osteopathy is and why you think it can be helpful for your patient. So, you need to think up an elevator speech. Now for a full elevator speech that I use you can take a look at the notes, but some quick tips that may help you out is saying that it's a hands-on treatment approach you can use it in the office today. It can help push your patient into a position where the body will heal itself. Things not to say is "Oh, it's like a chiropractor, but a little different" don't say that, you'll lose your points. Think up an elevator speech before PE day, so that when you get the question, you know what you're going to say. The next thing that you need to communicate is what you're doing and why? So, imagine this, you're going to the clinic with some sort of a complaint. The physician wants to give you a medication, but doesn't tell you what it is? Why he's going to give it to you? Or how he thinks it's going to help. It seems pretty crazy. It's the same thing with OMM. You need to be able to explain to your patient what you're doing and why you're doing it in terms that they can understand. So, you can't say you feel flex and side bend and rotated, they're not osteopathic physicians. They won't know what you're talking about, but you can say it feels like you can't move in this direction. I can perform a treatment that can help restore your range of motion. That would be better. So, think of something to say for what and why. The second person that you need to communicate with is the grader. Now the person grading the OMM portion of your PE is not going to be in the room with you. He's not going to be behind you palpating all of your palpatory findings. So, you need to be able to explain what you're feeling and why you are going to move on to whatever treatment plan based on that. The whole idea of the OMM portion of the PE is to see if you can take the palpatory findings and make a logical connection between that and what treatment technique you want to use and why you want to do it. So, you're helping yourself out if you say your findings out loud and then you go through your treatment out loud, so the grader can follow along logically. Now remember you can't say out loud flex, side bend and rotate, you can say their positional findings. So, it's in the patient terms, but just say it in a way that the grader can understand what you're saying. So, make sure that you say everything out loud. So, the next tip to keep in mind is variety. Now the OMM portion of the PE is to see if you have an understanding of osteopathic techniques. If you go in on PE day and for all of your osteopathic patients you perform counterstrain, you're not showing that you have a very wide knowledge of osteopathy in general. You're showing that you know how to perform counterstrain pretty well. That's not going to get you the points that you need on test day in order to pass. You need to show a variety. So maybe use a muscle energy technique, maybe use an indirect technique like FPR, use counterstrain, use myofascial, use a combination with all of your patients. Don't just stick to one treatment style but mix it up a little bit. So, some general tips is that each of your treatment should only take between three and five minutes. Don't kill all of your time with the patient trying to set up and perform as perfect treatment. Only stick to three to five minutes. You don't want to run out of time. One treatment that's easy to do is muscle energy. So, muscle energy is pretty easy. You put them into the barrier. You have them isometrically contract into the freedom. Do it three to five times, back to neutral, re-screen. So, this is a pretty easy autopilot that you can go onto to treat your patient osteopathically using muscle energy. You can also anticipate different treatments for different body parts that you may not have already learned. Just know put them in the barrier and to have them isometrically contract into the freedom. So, muscle energy is easy. Next is counterstrain. Now counterstrain is a good technique to use, but you need to plan ahead. Remember counterstrain takes a full 90 seconds. It's not like lab where you can say 1, 2, 89, 90. If you're in the PE and you perform counterstrain you need to make sure that you hold for the full 90 seconds. Now that 90 seconds can be detrimental if you're short on time, but it can also be very beneficial for you if you use it properly. During that 90 seconds you can explain your treatment plan, what you're doing, why you're doing it. You can communicate your entire thought process with the patient during that time. Don't sit there in silence, that's too awkward. Make sure that you use your time efficiently. So, if you do counterstrain, make sure to plan ahead for that full 90 seconds. Now one treatment technique that you don't want to use is HVLA. Now they say this rule everywhere when you're prepping for the PE. Don't use HVLA. It's a high-stress environment, so you may forget, but I'm telling you again. Don't use HVLA. The standardized patients are being seen by 12 students in the morning, maybe even 12 students in the afternoon. They're not going to feel very good at the end of the day if their back is being popped 24 times. Don't use HVLA, you're going to lose points and fail on that patient. So, no HVLA. Now your final treatment technique is myofascial. A myofascial is also pretty easy to use. It can be indirect, direct, active, passive really seems like you can just make up whatever you want to do for whatever muscle, but this technique is also incredibly easy for you to perform. So, in reality you should probably only use it once. Use Myofascial as your panic button. If you can't think of anything else and you freeze, go with myofascial one time. Don't use it on more than one patient, it's too easy and no matter what treatment technique you decide to do, every treatment ends exactly the same. You need to re-screen. You always need to re-screen your patient after every single treatment. You have to assess for efficacy and see if you actually did anything or not. If you did something your treatment was effective. If you didn't do anything, you might need to throw in another treatment. So, the next bit of advice is to anticipate. Now the PE rooms are set up in an ambulatory setting, so it's a good idea to anticipate some treatments that you may have to perform on your patients. Now here's where a little bit of truth comes into play. They're standardized patients. They may say that they have knee pain and they're there to be seen for an osteopathic treatment, but it's a standardized patient. They may or may not actually have somatic dysfunction findings for knee pain. So, it's really important in real life and in the PE that you screen every single patient, every single time. That way you can assess for any somatic dysfunction that you find and if you say your findings out loud, the greater can understand what you palpated and why you're deciding to treat that instead of whatever complaint that came in with. Remember the body is a big tensegrity unit. It's possible that back pain can cause knee pain. So just because they said knee, don't focus in on the knee. Make sure that you screen every patient, every time. So, screen your patients. Now going back to anticipation, what are some clinical things that you may see in an ambulatory setting. We'll draw out some examples. So, in the ambulatory setting there's a variety of reasons why a patient may come in with a complaint and you can potentially treat it osteopathically. So pretty good idea is to anticipate something that you may see. The patient comes in with a headache. You may be able to treat that using cranial. You can even perform a suboccipital release and if they complain of something like a cold or flu-like symptoms a facial sinus effleurage may be helpful. If they come in with an ear complaint, may be a good idea to perform the gall breath technique. If they come in with neck pain, you can start thinking about treating the cervical spine with muscle energy or any other treatment modality that you would like to use, or you can target your treatment at the SCM or the TRAPS. If a patient comes in with shoulder pain after they've been playing sports or maybe they were in a motor vehicle collision, take a look at the scapula and assess for a somatic dysfunction. Maybe even perform the Spencer technique in the shoulder, or maybe perform some counterstrain for the SITS muscles. If a patient comes in with back pain, there are plenty of different treatments that you can use for back pain, but this may be a good time for you to show your osteopathic variety and use something different than muscle energy. Maybe try an indirect technique like Still or FPR. So, let's do FPR for the T-spine. Maybe the patient has been coughing, because they've had a cold for the past couple weeks and now their chest hurts on the outside, maybe think of a rib dysfunction. So maybe you should screen the ribs and assess for a somatic dysfunction there. Let's say they were skateboarding, and they fell forward now their elbow hurts, maybe take a look at their radial head and treat that with muscle energy. Now remember the body is a big tensegrity unit. Pain in one place can cause pain or somatic dysfunction in another. If a patient presents with wrist pain, it would still be logical to check out the radial head. So, if you see a patient who might be complaining of wrist pain, maybe take a look at the radial head too, or maybe you could perform a carpal tunnel release. Maybe the patient has some hip pain after a long road trip, or maybe they fell going down the stairs. If they have some hip and pelvic pain, maybe take a look at the sacrum with the seated flexion test or maybe even the innominates with the standing flexion test. Take a look at the piriformis or psoas and you already know plenty of techniques to treat all of these locations, because you've already been through the video lessons up until this point. Maybe the patient comes in with knee pain after they fell or maybe they were playing soccer. One good place to look is maybe the fibular head. You can maybe even perform some counterstrain on the knee ligaments and once again the body is a big tensegrity unit. If they come in with ankle pain, it would be logical for you to still assess the fibular head. If it's not the fibular head you can potentially do some more counterstrain on some of the ligaments of the ankle. So, we went over a lot in these PE tips. Hopefully this will help decrease your stress and make you look forward to the OMM section on your PE. Just remember that you need to communicate with the patient and the grader. You need to show variety in your osteopathic treatments. Make sure that you only use myofascial one time as your panic button. Anticipate by screening every single patient and going in there with some treatment ideas in your back pocket just in case and that's OMM tips for the PE. 
NEW LESSON  
[OMM - Treatment Modalities]  
﻿We're going to do something pretty ambitious in this lecture. We're going to go over all of the high yield treatment styles that you're going to see in the clinic and while you're reading your textbooks. The purpose of this lecture is to give you an idea of all of the treatment styles and what makes them similar or different to one another. This lecture is also going to help you choose which treatment style you want to use for which sort of patient. This lecture is going to be a little bit longer, but it's set up like this on purpose so that we can go over everything all at once. During this lecture, the high yield points that you should pay particular attention to are which treatments are direct, indirect, active and passive. So to start off with, we're going to go over some quick vocabulary. So you can have an active treatment, means that the patient assists in the treatment. Meaning that at some point during an active treatment, you are going to ask the patient to do some sort of motion. A passive treatment is going to be the opposite. During a passive treatment, we're going to ask the patient just to remain completely still. At no point during the treatment do we ask the patient to do anything. There are two different types of treatment, and the first one is direct. The direct treatment is a treatment that directly engages the restrictive barrier. So remember, from the previous videos we were talking about how you always name a diagnosis based off what it can do. So the name of the diagnosis is the freedom. So the barrier is what they cannot do, so it's going to be the restriction. It's going to be the opposite of the freedom. So if the diagnosis is something like T6 flexed, rotated and side bending to the right, the barrier is going to be extended, rotating and side bending to the left. It's going to be the opposite. And indirect treatment is going to be the opposite. Instead of the engaging the barrier like we did for a direct treatment, we're going to engage the freedom, or what the patient can do. So why would you choose a direct treatment or an indirect treatment? It's going to depend on what sort of patient you see and what sort of dysfunction that they have. So the typical patient that you will choose a direct treatment for would be someone who's younger, who does not have too much pain during motion, and maybe even a dysfunction that's chronic. When you're doing a direct treatment, you're going to be engaging the barrier, or what they can't do. Sometimes this is a little bit painful or uncomfortable for the patient. If it's painful, then you're going to do something that's indirect. But if it's not painful, you can stick to direct. So indirect is going to be the opposite. You're going to do this for someone that may be older, who has pain with the dysfunction, and maybe something that's a little bit more acute. So if you think of an acute dysfunction, when it first happens it may be a little bit more painful than after you've been sitting on it for a while. So acute and painful, think indirect. Chronic, no pain, think of a direct treatment. So for the rest of this, we're going to go with one example, and I'm going to relate all of the treatments back to it so that you understand the barrier, the restriction, the freedom, all the vocabulary. So let's say that the dysfunction is going to be T7 FRS Right. So you always name it by what it can do. So T7 can flex, can rotate to the right, and can side bend to the right. This is the freedom. The opposite is what they cannot do, the restrictive barrier. So as I'm going through these examples, keep in mind direct, indirect, active, passive, barrier, freedom. So the first treatment style is going to be muscle energy. When I say muscle energy, what I want you to think of is isometric contraction. I want you to think of lengthening the muscle to engage the restrictive barrier and then an isometric contraction into the freedom that will then shorten the muscle. It'll make sense as I write this out. So there are two flavors of muscle energy. The first one is post-isometric relaxation. This is going to be a direct technique and also active. So this means that we are going to engage the barrier during treatment and we're going to ask the patient to move during the treatment and help us with the treatment. When you hear muscle energy, I want you to think of the golgi tendon organ. Without getting deep into the golgi tendon organ, it basically boils down to this. The golgi tendon organ recognizes that there is extra tension during treatment. It's going to tell the agonist muscle to relax, which is then going to allow the physician to move further into the barrier. So if you hear muscle energy, think golgi tendon organ. So how do I set up and perform this treatment? The first step is you are going to passively move the patient into the barrier. So the first step of the treatment is going to have the patient seated an relaxed so he is passive. You need to move him into the barrier. The barrier is what they cannot do. So if they can flex, rotate right, side bend right, they cannot extend, rotate left, side bend left. So the barrier is what they cannot do. The diagnosis is what they can do. Make sure you keep that straight. Once they are into the barrier, this is where you're going to ask the patient to assist during the treatment. You're going to have the patient actively isometrically contract to the freedom. So you have the patient engaged in the barrier already. You're going to ask the patient to move into the freedom. So move into the diagnosis, move into what they can do, which is flex, rotation right, side bend right. Remember from the previous lectures, we talked about what an isometric force is. So they're going to try and move in towards the freedom, but during treatment, you are going to hold them still and give them enough of a muscle force that keeps them in their position. So that's isometric. The patient pushes while the physician pushes, both forces cancel each other out and there's no motion. Once they actively move into the freedom for three to five seconds, you are then going to passively reengage the new barrier. So this is going to be the same barrier as before, but it's the new barrier since you can now go further into the barrier because of the golgi tendon organ telling the agonist muscle to relax. So new barrier, what they can't do, extended, rotate left, side bend left. The next step is going to repeat everything three to five times. Once you have performed the entire treatment three to five times, you can then bring the patient passively back to neutral and rescreen. At the end of every single treatment, whether it's muscle energy or anything else that we discuss, you have to rescreen and make sure that your treatment worked. So rescreen at the end of everything. So I said muscle energy comes in two flavors. You have post-isometric and reciprocal inhibition. This treatment style is going to be direct or indirect, but it will always be active. So direct or indirect, either engages the barrier or engages the freedom. You'll see the difference during setup. So if it's a direct treatment, you want to put the patient into the barrier during setup. So what's an example of this? The easiest way to think of reciprocal inhibition is going to be your biceps and your triceps. Your biceps will be the agonist muscle and the dysfunctional muscle, and your triceps will be the antagonist. So imagine that the patient has hypertonic biceps, meaning that they can go into flexion but they cannot go into extension. So if I'm going to directly engage the barrier, I'm going to ask the patient to do what they cannot do, which is go into the extension barrier. And then I'm going to have the patient contract their antagonist muscle, their triceps. If I want this to be an indirect treatment, I'm going to place the patient into what they can do, which is flexion, and then I'm going to ask them to engage their antagonist muscle, which is their triceps. So in reciprocal inhibition, you're always wanting to engage the antagonist muscle. In post isometric relaxation, your goal is to engage the agonist muscle. So for our example of the hypertonic bicep, if we want to directly engage the barrier, we're going to extend the bicep and flex the tricep. If I want this to be an indirect treatment, I'm going to place the patient into what they can do, which is a flexed bicep, and I'm still going to ask them to flex the tricep. Once you've done the treatment, you then put the patient back in a neutral and rescreen. So the next treatment style is going to be high velocity, low amplitude, or HVLA. Whenever we think about HVLA, think of the technique that causes the pops. So when we're talking about HVLA, think of popping and cracking. So HVLA. This type of treatment is going to be direct and passive. So during the treatment setup, we're going to engage the barrier and it's passive, we're not going to ask the patient to do anything. So the first step in this treatment is going to be passive motion into the barrier. So relating this back to our example, the patient's diagnosis is T7 flexed, rotated right, side bent right. This is what they can do. This is the freedom. So if we want to engage the barrier, we engage the opposite. So we'll want to engage extension, rotation left, side bending left. So the first step, passive to the barrier. The next step is to instruct the patient to relax, which mostly includes breathing techniques for them to relax. When you're trying to thrust through the barrier, it's a little bit easier when the patient is relaxed and their muscles aren't tense. Once you have the patient relaxed, then you are going to perform your HVLA thrust through the barrier. So we already have the patient in the barrier, which is extension, rotating left, side bending left. So the HVLA thrust goes through the barrier. So your thrust will further push them into extension, rotation left, side bending left. This thrust is what's going to cause your pop. After the treatment, bring them back to neutral and rescreen. So the next treatment style is facilitated positional release, or FPR. This treatment style is going to be a little bit different than muscle energy and HVLA. It's going to be indirect and passive. So this treatment is indirect. What we've previously been talking about is direct. So instead of engaging the barrier like we did for muscle energy and HVLA, we're going to set the patient up into the freedom first. So the first step is going to be passively moving the patient into the freedom. So for our example, T7 can flex, can rotate to the right, can side bend to the right. So we're going to passively move them into what they can do. So flexed, rotated right, side bent right. They're now into the freedom. The next step is going to add an activating force. So what's an activating force? When you're performing your treatment, you just add compression down to the segment of dysfunction. So that can be from the head and neck or that can be from the shoulders for any of the dysfunctions lower down in the spine. So you add the compression force next. In this example, T7 is dysfunctional, so you need to make sure that your compression force goes down to T7 for the treatment. Once you add the activating force, you are then going to passively move the patient further into the freedom. So you're going to put the patient into the freedom, what they can do. You add the activating force. With the activating force, you push them further into the freedom. So add the activating force, push them further into flexion, rotation to the right and side bending to the right. Once you do that, the treatment's been complete, so now you can passively return them back to neutral and then rescreen. So you release your force, return to neutral, and always rescreen. The next treatment style is going to be balanced ligamentous tension, or BLT. This treatment's going to be similar to FPR in that it's an indirect technique. So this treatment is indirect and passive. So like FPR where it's indirect, but not like muscle energy or HVLA that's direct. So for BLT, indirect, engage the freedom. The next step that you're going to do is engage the freedom in three planes of motion. So think about three planes of the motion of the diagnosis. You have flexion extension, rotation, and side bending. We're going to engage the freedom where it makes the tissues all neutral during your first step of the treatment. So indirect, what they can do, first step is passive on three planes. Once they're in the freedom for the three planes of motion, the next thing you do is just hold and wait for the release. Once they feel the release or the softening of the tissues, you then bring them back to neutral and rescreen. So again, with our treatment example, T7 is flexed, rotated right, side bent right. The three planes of motion that you're going to engage, flexion, rotation right, side bending right, into the freedom. Hold it there until you feel a release. Once that you do, neutral and rescreen. The next treatment is going to be still technique. Now still is going to be a little bit different. It's both direct and indirect, as well as being a passive treatment. So during this treatment, you're going to engage both the direct barrier or what they cannot do, and the indirect barrier or the freedom, what they can do, what the diagnosis is. So the first step of the treatment is going to be to passively move the patient into the freedom. So for our example, T7, they can flex, rotate right, side bend right. Put them into the freedom, so put them into flex, rotate right, side bent right. The next step is going to be to add an activating force. Once you have the activating force applied, this is where the direct portion of the treatment will begin. You add the activating force and then you move the patient into the direct barrier. So in this treatment so far, you have the patient what they can do, flex, rotate right, side bend right. You add the activating force and then you move the patient further into the barrier or what they cannot do, which will be extension, rotation left, side bending left. So now passive through barrier. Once there, you can then release your activating force, bring the patient back to neutral, and then you rescreen. Always rescreen. So up until now, all of the treatment styles we've talked about, I want you to think of using when you're treating something in the spine or some sort of a joint. The next three treatment styles we're going to go over, I want you to think about treatment a muscular dysfunction instead of treating a spinal dysfunction. So think muscle for the next three. This next one is going to be counter-strain. So counter-strain is an indirect treatment that is also passive. Now we have a whole video devoted strictly to counter-strain that comes on later in the series. But for right now, I want you to think of indirect treatment that's also passive. So if you're doing an indirect treatment, you put the dysfunction where it can go. If it's a hypertonic muscle, what it can do is bring the two ends of the muscle closer together. So for a counter-strain treatment, you're whole goal is to bring two ends of the muscle closer together. We're going to do this by folding and holding, or just shortening the muscle however we can. So when you think of counter-strain, think of fold and hold, which will shorten the muscle. The next treatment style is just going to be stretching. Now imagine stretch as just being the opposite of counter-strain. It's going to be a direct treatment. The whole goal is to elongate the muscle. So you're going to take the attachment and the origin and take them further apart by stretching the muscle. This can be accomplished by doing the opposite of whatever the muscle usually does. For example, if the bicep normally flexes, if I'm trying to stretch it I'm going to do the opposite. I'm going to extend it. So stretch is direct and passive. Your whole goal is to elongate the muscle. In this last treatment, it's really just about anything that you want it to be. It's myofascial. This can be direct or indirect, it can be active or passive. It all depends on how you set up the patient for treatment and if you're going to ask the patient to assist you or not. So myofascial. This can be direct or indirect and can be passive or active. In this treatment, you're going to move the muscles around in three planes of motion, including traction, rotation and compression. For a more indepth example, look later on in the series at the lumbar lecture. So how are we going to make this direct or indirect? It's easy. You either engage the barrier or you engage the freedom. So three planes of motion, which include traction, rotation and compression. Direct to the barrier or where the tissues cannot go, and indirect into the freedom. So when you're performing this technique and you're putting the patient directly into the barrier, you're going to put the tissue where it doesn't want to go. When you're pushing in that direction, you're going to have a hard end feel. It's going to feel very taut when you move that way. Indirect, you engage the freedom, when you move the tissues in that direction, it softens or loosens. So how do you make this treatment active or passive? This is where you use enhancers. So what's an enhancer? An enhancer is during your myofascial treatment, you ask the patient to contract whatever muscle you're treating. So for example, let's say you're doing myofascial to the diaphragm. You're doming it and pushing your fingers into the diaphragm. If you want them to contract, you can have them actively help you in treatment by deep inhaling and deep exhaling. This movement is going to make the treatment active and it's an enhancer. So enhancers make the treatment active. So these are all of the treatment styles that we're going to go over. You have muscle energy, where you think of post-isometric relaxation and reciprocal inhibition. Always think of isometric contraction. HVLA, think of the popping. FPR, where it's all indirect. BLT where you have the three planes of motion. Still technique where it's both direct and indirect. Move on to the muscular treatments, you have counter-strain which is fold and hold, stretching which is elongating the muscle, and myofascial which is really the grab bag of everything. So the important part of this is that you understand the concepts of direct, indirect, active and passive. So we're going to make a big chart with everything. So we have muscle energy, HVLA, FPR, BLT, still, counter-strain, stretch and myofascial. And each treatment can either be direct, indirect, passive or active. So what about muscle energy? Direct, indirect, active or passive? When you think muscle energy, think of it being direct, but also know that occasionally it can be indirect. This is an active treatment because the patient is actively helping you. He's doing some sort of muscle contraction. When you think of HVLA, it's direct, you're directly engaging the barrier, the treatment is passive because the patient relaxes, the patient doesn't do anything. FPR is indirect where you engage the freedom, and it's passive because the patient does not help you during treatment. BLT is the same, where it's all indirect and it's a passive treatment. Still is the weird one where it's both direct and indirect. Although when you're thinking of still technique in the clinic or on an exam or wherever else, think of still as being an indirect technique. But just know that it's both. So if you get asked to do an indirect technique and still is an option, think of indirect still technique. This technique is also passive, he doesn't help. Counter-strain is going to be indirect, where you engage the freedom and you shorten the muscle, and it's going to be passive where the patient does not help you. The stretch, you're elongating the muscle and doing what it cannot do. That's going to be direct and it's going to be passive, because the patient is not going to help. The myofascial, everything, depending on however you set it up. So it's direct, indirect, passive, or if you want to use enhancers, active. One final quick thought is treatment sequencing. When you're treating something, you always want to think of sequencing by starting centrally and working your way out peripherally. So just as an example, if I want to treat something in the hand and I'm thinking of sequencing, start in the thoracic area, then move out to the shoulder, then upper extremity, then your hand distal dysfunction. You want to do this in order to make sure that you hit all of the compensatory patterns along the way. So if you get asked about sequencing, think central, work out peripheral. So to sum up everything in this massive lecture, we talked about all the high yield treatment styles. We discussed active, passive, direct and indirect, which are your main things that you have to know about each treatment. Why you would use direct or indirect. We went through examples with all of them, and then we also did a chart that has everything that's super high yield. And that's OMM treatment techniques. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Beating Clinical Vignettes]  
﻿The reason why I enjoy teaching clinical medicine so much is that it does prepare you for both life and the test but the NBME shelves and the USMLE step two licensing exams common the form of Clinical Vignettes. Now, I actually think they've done a pretty good job of taking an automated test to a testing center that tests both knowledge and reasoning as best as a multiple choice question can. Specifically though, how you score on a multiple choice exam does not determine your value as a physician and it does not assess your clinical reasoning or your ability to practice medicine but those scores do matter in getting into residency. So as you begin to prepare for these exams, it'd be useful if you prepared for the exams and yes, that's learning the knowledge but also, learning how to beat the test by using good test taking strategy. I don't say this to brag but I took my internal medicine boards, a nine-hour exam in three and half hours and people ask me how do I prepare for a medicine board exam and I said I made OnlineMedEd, you probably shouldn't copy that pattern, it's pretty hard but at the same time having learned how to write questions in residency and practice writing them, I was able to take those tests much faster and much more efficiently and still get the answer right. I'll show you how. First, we want to learn how the test writer writes the question? How to write a question? The first thing a test writer does is determines what the educational objective it's going to be. It may be something as vague as how do you diagnose a CHF exacerbation? Or what medications do you use to treat coronary artery disease? Or it could be something very specific like in [indiscernible] how do you anticoagulate a fib and who do you anticoagulate in? But they choose an educational objective and that is going to be the question they ask. Then they choose a right answer and that's usually going to be in the way of what is the best next step in the management, how do you treat, how do you diagnose, what is the diagnosis or something as simple as polypharmacy is bad, how do you avoid doing unnecessary things in the elderly? There's going to be one right answer and notice the vignette hasn't even been considered yet but this is what they do, educational objective first, then the right answer. Then they're going to write the wrong answers. The wrong answers are called distractors, a good distractor is one that it sounds attractive to someone who only has lose word association. That is if you only study buzzwords, you're going to get pulled into a trap. Wheezing asthma? They're going to give you a wheeze, but it won't be asthma, because they know that word association exists and they'll purposefully change of in yet to make it non-asthma even though there's wheezing or distractor is the right thing to do for a disease, just not at that time. Esophageal varices should be given propranolol or nadolol as an outpatient, turning an acute hemorrhage, they should not be given. Esophageal varices one vignette makes nadolol the right answer, one makes it absolutely the wrong answer. So a distractor is one that sound attractive or could be right if the vignette was adjusted a little bit and then they build the vignette and in that vignette what they're going to do is include the positives that are required for the right answer. The elements of the illness script for the right answer will be present and then they're going to spend a little bit of time making sure that those that the detractors, the wrong answers are listed as negative and this is very important. Even in the electronic exams they don't have 10 minutes per question. So they cannot write you a full history in physical. It's only couple of lines. So in those couple of lines, they need to make it clear that one answer is right and all the other answers are wrong and the idea will be that you will get the things you need in that vignette at the USMLE step one and two level, there are no curve balls. What they give you is what they need. So you start stacking up the things that go along with the right answer and you start crossing off the wrong answers because the things you should be looking for aren't there. This is also the danger of getting other Qbanks. We do not mold our questions that is to say as we'll talk about in a minute how do you learn from these questions. We test one educational objective one way and then we explain in the answers why the other ones are wrong for that one vignette and what you can do to change the vignette to make that distractor correct. In that way we make five questions out of one but we only give you one question a lot of Qbanks in order to pad their numbers ask the same question again, only tweak two things and make a different answer right and it's a new question, we don't do that but recognize it's also based on a hinge. Most of the time, you have to know the diagnosis from the vignette MI? Before you can ask the hinge what medication impairs mortality, beta blocker? What's the most common cause of death in 24 hours? What's the pathology look like after a week? What's Dressler's syndrome. They can ask all of these questions based on the same vignette which says, this person is having an MI. Okay. So this is how they write the questions. How should you actually take the exam? The first thing you're going to do and I say this with great emphasis because even my own residence don't do this, we have the question of the day, even after me poking and prawning and making them do it, they still do it out of order. The first thing you should do is read the question? Read the question first, that is always going to be the last line of the vignette. Read the question, the hinge first, then read the options, the answer choices next. What's you're doing is priming your brain. You want to at least know what universe you're in and usually it's going to be along the same question of what is the best next step in management and if what you see as answer choices are iron, IV estrogen, uterine artery ligation transfusion, you know it has something to do with uterine bleeding. Whereas if you saw aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, low molecular weight heparin therapeutic dose, you're probably in the coronary artery disease section and so first, you should be able to identify that this is OB, this is cardiology but then if you can identify the educational objective and then only once you've read the answer choices and the question do you then go back and read the vignette. To prove a point, I know this has happened to everyone, think about that time you read the vignette and you are so excited because you knew what the diagnosis was, you're highlighting all the things that were right for that diagnosis, you're like, okay, this is a stroke, I got it and then it asks you what seizure medicine should you give? And you're like, huh? I thought this question is about stroke? Well, you wasted that entire time which you had go back, undo all you're highlighting and read the vignette again, because, oh, my God it's not at all what I thought or that time you're completely lost in that vignette and you have no idea what's going on and then only after you read the question and the answer choices because you start narrowing them down. Often, you can narrow it down to one or two just by reading the question and the answer choices and then as you go through the vignette having already primed your brain with the universe and educational objective, you're looking for those pertinent positives and pertinent negatives. In the case, in order to help you forget what the right answer is, that's how you can accelerate and not get trapped when five things fit and one thing is off, because you're looking for multiple things in and if the vignette gives you five things that points you to one direction, that's where they're going for. The last question is going to be how do you learn or how do you use a Qbank. There are two ways to use a Qbank. The first one is to learn. The second one is to practice. Questions must be done to do well On STEP. You have to practice doing questions in order to do the questions. Very much like a boxer has to train in the gym sparring in order to actually prepare for the fight. If he does a bunch of skipping rope, he's going to have great cardio but he won't have any technique. So you have to do the thing that happens on game day. You must practice. But to use questions, a Qbank to learn involves this. You should do the Qbank untimed and with tutor mode on, so that every question you do, you follow the same path, read the question, read the answers then read the vignette, select an answer and read the entirety of the explanation. Don't feel satisfied ha, I guessed right this time. What you want to be able to do is say, I know why the right answer is right, I also know how to change the vignette to make the other answers wrong and a lot of Qbanks, even very advanced ones, just tell you why the answer is wrong but they don't tell you it's a good distractor. They just tell you why it was stupid and you never pick it. Instead a good well-written question is going to have four distractors which are all legit and the explanations to tell you why those distractors are wrong this time and what you could do to make them right. If you're going to use a Qbank for practice it should be timed, tutor mode off and you read only the answer explanations of the ones you've got wrong. The idea as we'll discuss in the next lesson is that when you're learning, you want to engage all the material. When you're practicing, what you want to do is feel what it's like to take 44 questions in a row. To do it seven times in a row and when you get fidgety, when do you start freaking out? When do you need to take a break? How long a break do you need to take? How well can you attend two blocks in a row? Is that a good idea? You're not trying to get any more knowledge force in here, you're just simulating what it's like to take the test, where in learning you want to go slow and make sure you engage all the explanations to maximize that learning. Okay. So we spent a lot of time on how to write the question and if you know how people write the question it makes sense then on how to take it. Read the question and the answer choices looking for the educational objective, you can generally narrow it down to two or three answers, then you read the vignette looking for the things that you expect in the illness script, the things that we taught you in the videos and in the notes that are then going to increase or decrease the likelihood that that one is the right answer and you pick the one that has the most pluses and to use a Qbank, decide whether you're going to learn, go slow, be thorough or practice, get through them, feel what it's like to take the test. That is Education Questions. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Intro to Education]  
﻿At OnlineMedEd we have created an adult learning paradigm that maximizes effectiveness and efficiency. It's based on adult educational theory, research in the field who haven't made this thing haphazardly and if you follow the script we give you, follow the schedule, do exactly what we say, you're going to do well but not everyone is going to commit like that. So, what I want to do in the next series of lessons is show you what's out there, that is give you the concepts, the maps behind why you'd pick one thing over another. I believe that most medical students as they enter medical school know how they want to study, in groups, in pairs, on their own, questions, reading, lessons, videos, lectures, whatever you're learning style. The problem is you've made those conclusions in an environment that was based on the wrong thing, 45 minute long PowerPoint lectures given in a dark room in one hour slots where you had to start when the lecture was ready. Which means you probably played Clash of Clans, checked your email and went on to ESPN.com rather than paying attention or you just didn't go at all because that's not how you study. As I say, most medical students succeed in spite of their medical school not because of and so what I want to do is explore the things that are going to get you to succeed and this is useful because success at this point in your life is not about getting a score, step two scores matter, they do but at this point, it's about learning the foundations for the rest of your life. So, test success and life success are obtained the same way. So, this introduction just gives the outline of what the next series is going to look like, we're going to talk about study materials that is resources. What's out there, what are the different types of resources or study materials and how do you best utilize them. Of course, since the USMLE step two is all about multiple choice questions and vignettes. We are going to talk about clinical vignettes, how they're written and once you understand how they're written, you can understand how to take the test better and also how to benefit from doing questions, more in that in that lecture. We're also going to talk about the phases of learning and this is more about STEP prep than it is life prep, the idea being that you need to have rigorous study periods and then also training for test day where that rigorous training is going to be what you're going to do for the rest of your life as you learn the medicine in your chosen field but then also understand that there is a right away to prepare for test day and if you know what you're doing, you can plan accordingly and lastly, to sort of set some schedules, that is what is your actual goal and how much are you willing to commit to studying, how much time do you have and then you can build the right schedule for the right goal. Both of these are more a STEP prep than they are life and then OnlineMedEd is not based haphazardly on something we made up, right, it's based on adult education theory and so, for those of you who want to know why we do what we do in the way we do it and why it's so effective and so efficient, this won't help you practically but at least you'll know some insight behind what we do, there's the final fifth video called educational theory. So in the next couple of lectures I'm going to show you our paradigm and why we do what we do. Even if you don't want to use our paradigm, you want to do whatever you want, I want you walking away with a good concept of what's the right way to use resources, what are my realistic goals and how hard am I going to have to work and based on those goals what should I actually do rather than rely on whatever recommendation came from the class before and what do you got and he was one class above you and he thinks they did pretty well. That is Introduction to Education. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Making Sense of Educational Resources]  
﻿You can find the written version of this on your dashboard in the resources tab on the shelf and STEP prep study guide. What I want to talk about here are the different resources that are out there and I don't mean like name the brands, I mean identify and quantify what resources are available and how you should use them. Everyone is going to learn differently, everyone's going to prefer one over another but I want you walking away from this lesson knowing what your options are and how best to use them and we'll finish off with our learning paradigm and why we've chosen to do that. Well first, since learning usually occurs self-directed in medical school, is books but it's important you understand the different types of books that are out there and there are three kinds. There's the review book, the reading book and the reference book. The idea here is that as you go down the list you go up on the detail. First and foremost, never use a reference book to study. The only time you should touch a reference book is when you are asked to give a detailed talk to your team and only the specialist on the team is going to understand when you speak and everyone is going to be completely bored by you. Reference books are those ones that are online, but also things like Harrison's for medicine and Williams for gynecology. The tones that are so enormous they're not even worth reading and some people will tell you, you should read those reference books. No, you should not. You will not have the time to get through them and even if you do you're not going to remember anything from them. Reference books are about truth, not understanding. Everything we do here is about understanding and retention. Reference books, good for truth, truth you don't need as a medical student. You need black and white, yes-no, classic illness scripts. Not all the details about everything all the time. So the two were going to engage are the review books and the reading books, and the review books are going to be there primarily for memory that is repetition and retention. You've seen these review books, you've probably used one for step one. That's going to be things like first aid step up. The review book traditionally is just the bulleted lists tables, if you read the review book without ever having gauged the content, you wouldn't know what anything meant and some people like to use it as a way to prime, I don't recommend that. Instead, what I recommend is that you learn the material well and then you engage that review book to trigger memory cues and on OnlineMedEd, this is called quick tables. The reading book is the thing that takes a narrative form; complete sentences paragraphs, pictures, diagrams, but it's not so much that you can't get through it, ACP essentials is a great example of this, if you start talking about Harrison's and Williams' and Schwartz, no go. At OnlineMedEd these reading materials are the notes and the notes are in eight and a half by eleven, one-page or two-page per lesson. Small amount of reading to do but the idea is you read the material to get acquainted with it before you then go on to learn it. We all know about lecturers. Right? And this is sort of why OnlineMedEd was created in the first place because we've all been through those in-person lectures. Now, you know that person who lectures phenomenally and you get so excited, when like that person is going to give a lecture the whole class shows up and they lecture for an hour but you've been there, an hour-long PowerPoint talks in a dark room where you either fall asleep because the guy is going on and on and on about some detail you don't care about or you check your email or ESPN, so we're getting rid of that. Now, of course being in person if you're very good at it is that there's a value added but most of the time in-person lectures are going to be really the person who has memorized their PowerPoint and drones on and on. So instead, we put our lectures online and the online lectures, that is the videos which are free allow you, the learner, to start, stop, repeat, speed up or whatever, you're in total control as opposed to starting when the lecturer is ready, you start when you're ready and being audiovisual it gives you another ahead at the stuff you had just read in the notes. Being in medical school, I know you know this already but to succeed you must do questions but it is important that you do not just do questions, you must do a USMLE style vignettes. What that means is not there's a very long paragraph that's obnoxious and describe something, what I mean is that it has to be a second order question. What is the best next step? What is the diagnosis? That is, you must first make the diagnosis from the vignette then they ask you a question, a detail about the thing you've just identified. You have to first make the diagnosis of myocardial infarction before you know to give a beta blocker as opposed to the questions that I've asked, what's the side effect of a beta blocker? That may still be asked but in a very different way. This of course is our Q bank. Now, to talk about it a little bit in a moment how we intend you to need to use the Qbank. Lots of people use Qbanks just to study from and of course we have the next lesson which is how to do questions and then there are flash cards and flash cards you have to be very careful about. Flash cards is available in the Flashback app as well on the dashboard in the flash cards. Flash cards are useful if they're used as a memory tool like the review book. Test writers want you to have free word association. Wheezing-asthma and they're going to give you a question about wheezing and asthma is going to be a choice but it has nothing to do with asthma. If you just loosely learn and rather than getting the entire illness script that is the patient presentation, diagnosis and treatment and you don't know a little bit about it, all you know is some loose word association that are going to trap you with distracters as we'll talk about in the questions section. So flash cards are useful, but only when used in conjunction with other resources that help solidify the information you're learning rather than try to teach it to you from the start and there's some other things I didn't put up here that is like journal articles, primary literature, academics hate that I say this and I am an academic myself but I really don't think that you should be reading reference books or primary literature, it's not worth it. You have to first learn that the person who has a crushing substernal chest pain has an MI and that everyone with coronary artery disease needs beta blockers [indiscernible] before you start reading about primary literature in the most up and coming stuff. Right? In medical school you must learn the classic illness script, black-white, yes-no. So these are the different options you have and you've probably figured this out from your own university or your own searching on forums, you must have a review book and you must have questions. It doesn't matter which book you pick as long as you have one of the main review sources and the Qbank that is learn the material you absolutely must identify on the test and practice for the test, okay. At OnlineMedEd we've created our learning paradigm called PACE. Which stands for prime, acquire, challenge and enforce and we go into more detail on this on that last lecture in educational theory. The idea is that you do P, A, and C at once and then you use E when it's right. Let's talk about it in just a second. For prime, what we want you to do is read the notes and then in that scene session after you finish reading the notes, taking down your own notes in the quick tables, you then watch the video. You just read the same material and now you get it again audiovisual and of course we keep our lessons short because that's how adult learners learn. But then we want you to take that information you just learned and force you into a new uncomfortable situation where you actually have to use it. That is the challenge portion where you use the Qbank. Now, you don't have to follow PACE rigidly. If you do, you'll have success but not everyone's going to want to do all the pieces and sometimes you'll want to save the questions for later on when you're preparing for the test not necessarily at the same time. You can use these resources however you want but our learning paradigm is set up to maximize understanding and retention. We do that by delivering it in multiple modalities, repeating that same information in different ways challenging you a little bit and then when it's the right time to use the quick tables and the Flashback app to cue up key things in memory. Forty-eight hours after you watch a video your flash cards become active because at 48 hours is what the maximum time to reengage that memory to solidify it and you get extra repeats of the must-know information to the quick tables, alright. These are the resources you have to choose from. Do you have to use all of them? No. Do you have to use any one? Probably not, but I would definitely get that review book and the Qbank but then as we're going to talk about you may have to set your own goals, how long you have and what do you want to score and what's your baseline but when you choose a study schedule or when you choose a study system, I want you to know what you're picking and why knowing the limitations of each of the different things that are available and most importantly stay away from primary literature and reference books. They're too much to study for where you're at. That is Education Resources. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Our Educational Theory]  
﻿This final lesson on Educational Theory will probably serve no practical purpose for most students who come to the site. It's only here for you to under it out with me if you're interested in medical education or you want to know why we've chosen to do what we do. So I want to start off with the VARK organizer for the different learning styles and move through how to maximize skills and then mitigate skills decline and finish off with Bloom's taxonomy. I'm going to use a little bit of a lingo that's involved in the education theory but I'm going to show you more how it's practically used by us and I'm not going to go deep into some weird pathophysiology of education. But let's start off with the different types of learning models and a pretty well-established model is VARK, which attempts to codify the different types of learners that there are. VARK stands for Visual, Aural or Audio, R is Read-write, and K is Kinesthetic. Now, Kinesthetic doesn't necessarily map very well into an online curriculum. Kinesthetics are going to be those people who like to use the little robot arms to tie a suture but you can see that already likely how we've taken this version of learning styles and ensured that PACE includes something for everyone. Now, people say, oh, I'm not a visual learner, I mean, that's garbage, of course you are, 10% percent of your brain is dedicated to vision, you're a visual learner unless your blind. Right? But what they say is, oh, I'm not a visual learner, I hate lecture, is that that person is probably Read-write predominant. No one is just one but people have different ways of learning and the idea is that we created PACE, we've created OnlineMedEd to satisfy all potential learning styles. So if you don't like PACE but you love the notes and the videos, you can use the notes and videos, it still works, but we've created it in a way that uses audio visual in the way of the videos. Visual Read-write in the way of the notes and note taking as well as Kinesthetic in the way of the questions and the Qbank. In addition, we've also stuck with what we know about adult learner behavior. You'll notice that with some rare exceptions all the videos are less than 20 minutes. This is because that is the average time an adult learner can attend something. Even better when their speed is accelerated to 1.5 or 2X, it feels faster. What you'll notice, if you remember from phase one we said a pretty good student can probably tackle prime, acquire, challenge, in about an hour. The reason for that is its 20 minutes to read the notes, 20 minutes to watch the video and 20 minutes to do the questions and it might take a little longer for a slower learner but the point is, each section, each block is about 20 minutes which is the maximum time an adult learner can to pay attention, unlike the 55-minute long PowerPoint lectures that you probably did in the basic sciences and it also affords an opportunity to break. This is the other thing that we know about adult learners, they can't sit in a classroom for four hours. It doesn't work. No one pays attention and so, at the end of reading your notes you can go cook dinner or make out with your wife or pet your cat or whatever and like you can do whatever you want and come back to the lesson, you don't have to sit there for an hour, you can do it in 20-minute blocks. So we've taken all the different learning styles that someone has and purposefully used, what we know about adult learning behavior to generate PACE. The benefit of this is to maximize skills and then to mitigate skills decline. Let's first talk about maximizing skills. Maximizing skills in this point is basically medical knowledge and a little bit of your ability to take multiple choice questions. I mean that's not really what I wanted to do but it's a byproduct of preparing you for STEP and actually this is not a STEM prep program but this is the foundations for the rest of your life as you'll see we use advanced education principles like blocking and also advanced organizers to help you understand and retain the information, really I'm getting ahead of myself. When you walk in to clinicals you effectively start here and you can still be successful on your own. Right? You know probably your own learning style even if someone hasn't codified for you and so you get to work and you begin to learn. Now, never will you be as knowledgeable and as proficient as you are at the end of residency, medical school, ah, but the point is as you begin to learn you're going to peak and afterwards you're probably just going to decline because you start taking short cuts and you don't keep up the literature, it's okay, you're still doing good, it's just the natural course of learning. So ideally, you'd want to find a resource that takes your slope like this, so that at the same time point, you have learned more and done better. The way we do that is by using repetition, multiple modalities, mapping VARK to prime, acquire, challenge and enforce, notes, videos questions, quick tables, flashcards and it is a blended and integrated approach. Right? These are not elements that have been created separate from each other by different people and we just thrown together and say okay that's the course. No, the people who make the notes, make the videos, make the Qbank, make the quick tables. Yeah, it's me in front of the camera but there are guys behind the scenes making it so everything fits together but this has an extra side effect that is it mitigates skills decline. Let's say we've chosen to do the right thing and learned a lot. Right? So now the person who started at nothing finishes their training having done really well. Now ideally what would happen is you just learn everything and it stays just as good. Getting back to our swimmer, if someone takes a couple of years off from swimming they're probably never going to be a national competitive swimmer again because what ends up happening as you take shortcuts and start to practice and life gets dragged and you don't keep up, what happens is you plummet and that's the natural way things go. Now, you know the phrase, it's like riding a bicycle. If you just ride a little bit more the skills come back, you may not be that you know that competitive athlete that you used to be, but alright but then as you begin to not use the bike anymore you decline and then you start to use it again, okay and so this is what we've unintentionally done by using things like advanced organizers. The color codes, the algorithms, the pictures or the mnemonics, those are a way of creating foundations, the illness script within a disease is set. So that every time you engage chest pain, if you see the little guy with his arms up and the intern book with a guy holding the rifle, this is in the next level topics for medicine. If you see that every time, every time you think about someone with chest pain it's not just do they have coronary artery disease or not it's you're seeing the method and so, you're re-engaging close to where you want to be advanced organizers blocking the material building the foundation allows you to have something to add on as you go through residency you realize truth is actually more important than understanding. Right? You have to know all there is to know about the thing that you're specializing in but in the beginning understanding was more important than truth so you have a baseline. Now, the things you're not going to specialize in it, you're not going to make more robust illness scripts but if you have this framework to attach on details to it's easier to hold on to that information and reengage it. So because we've had you do repetition of alternate modalities and because we use advanced organizers this is really is the foundations for the rest of your life and you go through residency to get the experiential learning to get the details but it's always mapped back on to what we do here and lastly, is Bloom's taxonomy. This is definitely the most nerd alert. Bloom's taxonomy as I see it is a way of maturing someone's ability and I'll break it down into three. There's more than this, but this is how you can simply understand it and the most basic form at the bottom of the pyramid is facts and memorization. Right? What is the dose of metoprolol, 25 milligrams of BID? Simple rote memorization but then you begin to be able to analyze, so you see a case, a person, the history, that forces you to use facts and memorization in a new way to put those things together rather than just regurgitate and ultimately you pass on to synthesis, where you generate new concepts and new ideas on your own without even having to be given a case to begin with. See how this works with OnlineMedEd, at the MS, three, four years, yeah, you have to learn the facts. Understanding is more important than truth, black and white, no curveballs. This is where you're going to see most of PACE. You're going to see prime, acquire and enforce. The quick tables and the flashbacks are literally just rote memorization but then you can start doing challenge here at the analysis phase. The Qbanks are designed to be done after you've read the notes and watch the videos because they want you to get facts and memorization as first and then challenge yourself by doing a clinical vignette that forces you into a situation which you may not have the answer and ultimately, once you get into residency, we have things like clinical cases and the next level content where you make your illness scripts more robust and you actually see real live people who have real live ambiguity that had real live questions come up now on rounds and so, you get to have that experience without actually seeing the person but it takes you, it takes you up the chain to getting into a complete independence and maintaining your skills. This is a little bit on Educational Theory, you're probably not going to get any practical use out of this, so thank you for those of you who watched. Just know that we at OnlineMedEd have used Educational Theory and research to construct our model, we didn't just make it up and it does two things, it gets you learning more faster and also creates a system where you can hang on to that knowledge as you go through life and we've done it based on Educational Theory that exists not just haphazardly thrown in together. That Educational Theory. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - Schedules and Expectations]  
﻿What I want to talk about in this lesson is the schedules that you can create using OnlineMedEd content and so far we've talked about how to do questions, the different review materials there are in order to prepare studying the different phases of learning and now I want to get into the practical aspects of how do you actually get it all done? I want to remind you that we've created this integrated blended model where you get different modalities to teaching you the same content that helps it stick and enhances understanding and retention. It's a little extra work reading and watching and doing questions, writing notes but we do it in a way that's purposefully integrated so that it actually becomes more efficient and more effective. The way we expect you to use this course is in the one year plan and I don't mean you're going to be studying for Step two for a year. What I mean is, you're going to be in phase one, the learning phase for most of the year and the idea is you're going to study block by block. The benefit to this method is that you do one lesson per day. It's about one hour for a fast student with a good foundation about two hours for a slower student, so plan accordingly but what you're going to do is PACE. Back to back to back you're going to prime by reading the notes, you're going to acquire by watching the videos and you're going to challenge doing the QBank and eventually at time repetitions you're going to enforce with quick tables and flashcards and in our block it's really easy, right, because you're only going to be studying that subject. I don't want you reading obstetrics when you're doing medicine. So, in obstetrics, you're going to read only the OB-GYN section of the quick tables. So, during the week, you are going to PACE one lesson per day. There's only 225 lessons total, working some time for vacation there and winter or summer recess and you've got about one lesson per day for the entirety of through third year or your clinical clerkships, you come out on the other end having trained up really well and then all you need to do is Taper a little bit and you crush the test. The problem is though that in this block by block method, the duration of the block is going to vary. Some rotations are only four weeks and that's usually things like neuro and psych. Some people have eight week rotations crammed into six weeks and that gets people into trouble because there may not be enough time to do every lesson in the major topic. Most rotations for the cores are eight weeks, things like IM, surgery, Peds and OB-GYN. Now for those people who are fortunate enough to have 12 week core rotations. You're probably going to have no trouble in getting all your lessons done within the block. What I want you to feel is, you're going to be in phase one learning, prime, acquire, challenge and enforce, one lesson per day and of course you're not going to remember everything from the beginning of the year but it's really easy to come out of that, watch something at 2X or blow through your notes real quick and all of a sudden and all comes rushing back because you solidified it so well but in general if you're trying to plan your block what you want to look at is the longer duration blocks. The goal would be to repeat lessons, do the full prime, acquire, challenge and enforce multiple times and include a Taper phase for yourshelf. For example, we've only got 25 topics in pediatrics, if you're on a 12 repeat pediatric rotation, you're going to get through a lesson three times, one lesson per day and that's okay because some other times you're going to like enter medicine where you realize you're going to push it. By the way these schedules are available in your shelf and Step guide on your resource tab in your dashboard. On the contrary, for shorter blocks you're going to be grinding. You may not get through everything, you're only going to be doing each lesson once and this is where it's really important to rest the day before the test, like actually take a break because you're going to be running into the test day having grinding the entire time. So you're going to be able to pick which version you've got and we have some things to help you out but the yearlong plan is the way we intend on you doing it so that you don't feel overburdened but some people come to us when they're already done with clerkships, they haven't heard of us or they didn't use us and they're like, "Hey, I still want to use your curriculum, what can I do to study for Step?" Now if you're intending on using the phases of learning, phase one, phase two, you're going to use PACE and then Taper, people ask me, "How can I do it in four weeks, is that enough time?" No, it's not. If you're only going to spend four weeks, you need to set realistic goals. So, the first thing you want to do if you're coming to us for the first time fresh for step two only is set goals. What I'm talking about is the difference between pass and perform. Fundamentally, what this means is in the pass category what you want to do is get all the same questions right that everyone else is going to get right. To do that, you don't need us, there are plenty of resources that get that done, we're happy to have you, what I want you to feel is that we are more designed for the long haul, the long-term success. To do a pass, really you can do this in less than four weeks and what I recommend you do is go and get a review book and a QBank. You get through that review book once or twice in a month, you do all the questions in a learning manner, take the test but the thing is, that if you really want to perform, if you really want to learn the medicine and have that stick, we'll talk more about this in the educational theory video that follows, you're going to want to try to get a 250 plus you're going to need augmentation. To do augmentation, you have to put in that extra effort and to put in an extra effort realistically, I think you're going to need more than four weeks, this is PACE and then it transitions into a Taper phase. This is doing it the way we intended it only you're accelerating it by doing a whole bunch of lessons per day. So, if you're talking about performance, augmentation, what you're really referring to is you're going to get all the core information, no problem, right? That's going to come up over and over and over again and you can be reasonably sure if it ends up in a review book or in a QBank you're probably going to see it but for augmentation, you're going to have to learn five to six things you're not going to see on the test in order to get one extra point. You need to be honest with yourself. Are you able to keep up with the grueling pace? Are you able to put in eight, twelve hours per day and are you able to do that for an extended period of time? If the answer is no, I still got by Sub-I going on, I want to prepare for Step 2 during my Sub-I. You're just not going to make that, the time to do what you need to do, so keep it simple. But if what you care about is getting the 250 or more, you're willing to put in the time and the effort, well, there's just two different ways you can do this. For Step-Prep, there is the eight week grueling pace where you're going to work 10 to 12 hours per day and you're going to do it six to seven days per week and your goal is to get in six to eight lessons per day. It's going to take you about six weeks. That schedule is printed out for you versus the slightly less grueling version which is going to be the 12 week plan where you're only going to put in eight hours a day and your goal is to get four lessons. Now even when I do remediation and I use this plan within internal medicine no student takes eight hours to do four lessons. They come in and get our early which is fine but they're blocking off enough time to get it done but also not burnout and the idea here, you'll go a little slower have a little bit more breathing room but it takes longer to get through versus the grueling pace. Now we have these resources on your dashboard to help you plan your study strategy but I want to reiterate the best way to use OnlineMedEd is in the phase one learning using it through all your clerkships, learning and consolidating all of that information and then when you come out on the other side having already done it, you just blow through the videos at 2X, Taper through a QBank, get a 250 but if you're willing to put any effort and the time to come do it in a dedicated study period, we're here for you as well. That is Education Schedules. 
NEW LESSON  
[Primer Methods for Success - The Phases of Learning]  
﻿In this lesson, what I want to talk about are the Phases of Learning. Now, see how that correlates with actually constructing a schedule, whether we're doing it yearlong, three month or two month plan for a shelf or STEP prep, that's the next lesson that follows, in this one, I want to talk about the Phases of Learning and I actually want to actuate it to an athlete. It make sense that a boxer in order to be a competitive challenger would have to be more than the sum of his parts, that is to say once he gets into the ring on the big fight day he's going to need to have done strength training, so that when he hits, he hits hard, he's going to have done speed training and agility training so that when he moves or tries to block, he can, he's also going to need to have done endurance, running bleachers and skipping rope in order to keep up the stamina to go 10 rounds but all the while who also need to have sparred in order to keep up his skills as a boxer. In the same sense, that training, that high intensity, multiple modality training that's effective for athletes can be effective for you when it comes to game day, that is the test, so, we'll talk about phase one which is actuating to modalities, to building a well-rounded athlete but then very much like a swimmer who may train every stroke to practice as a day two hours of practice during the on-season, as the big meet comes up the Taper, the Taper is designed not to lose anything but you're not trying to make any gains either, the idea being during that prep phase, that intense phase, you got to that as competitive of an athlete as you're going to get, and the Taper makes sure you maintain without burning out, both also without losing anything and then the night before, you don't do anything, it sucks to walk into the ring with a pulled muscle, so you take it easy, three phases of being an athlete, three Phases of Learning. Phase one is called the learning phase, this is equivalent to training and the idea is and to be a well-rounded athlete you have to attack the body from multiple modalities, the same is true of challenging your brain to be the ultimate test taking machine, this is effectively PACE, prime, acquire, challenge, and then enforce. That is for each topic as you're going through phase one of learning, you are intended, this is why the pages are set up this way to read the notes, prime your brain to the key issues then immediately the following the notes watch the videos, all the while taking notes into your quick tables in the margins, things you missed or things you didn't understand or some light bulb that went off that may not have gone off before and after you've done the notes and videos in the same session you're supposed to do the Qbank questions that go along with that lesson. The idea is that we are hitting the weight room speed and agility of the boxer correlated to multiple modalities. Now this sounds like a lot of work and you may be surprised to find that doing the same content in multiple modalities is a lot of work but we've done it in a way that is effective and efficient, for an advanced student, someone who has a really good foundation already and has done well on previous multiple choice exams it takes about an hour to get through prime acquired challenge, 20 minutes to read, 20 minutes to watch, 20 minutes to do the questions, for the average student it takes about two hours a day. Now when someone says, man I got to student two hours per day on top of my 12 hours shifts, now you've got the quick tables to bring with you, but yeah, that's the idea by doing it, by using multiple modalities, by repeating the same information but in different ways, you promote understanding and retention, you might get it a little different in one modality to another and in doing so, it clarify topics and the repetition makes it stick, then at specific intervals you're going to engage the enforce. Which is the quick tables and the flash cards, we have it set up so that 48 hours after you do a lesson the flash cards become active for that lesson, 48 hours is the designated time by research that says that's the time to re-engage this stuff you've learned in order to solidify it. During the week you're going to go lesson by lesson, notes, videos, Qbank, flash cards 48 hours later and on the weekends you're going to hit the quick tables, it is a lot of work becoming a competitive athlete but with the materials we give you in a course that's designed to be blended, you're going to get purposeful re-enforcement, it's not haphazard, it's designed this way which makes your studying very effective and time efficient. This is going to be the majority of your study, phase one learning and much like that swimmer, as they prepare for the big meet they enter phase two, phase two is simulation. This is the Taper, the idea here is that sense you've learned everything in the learning phase, you're not going to learn anything new, in fact if you try you're probably just going to lose something else in the way that the swimmer might try to grow before a big meet, he's not going to be a 100% come swim day. So, as you prepare for the test you want to simulate exactly what it's going to be like without trying to learn new things, to do that, you're going to do the day, every day the same way during the Taper. You are going to go to sleep at the same time as you were going to do on testing, you're going to wake up at exactly the same time, you're going to eat the same thing at the same time every day and you're going to feel what it's like to do seven blocks of 44 questions, you are going to do a simulation of the actual test. You want to feel what it's like after two straight blocks, do you need to take 10 minutes every block or can you take 40 minutes after two, when are you going to eat lunch, how much are you going to eat, what's it like if you have a bottle of water extra, you're not trying to learn any new information, you're just practicing with what you got, you're maintaining through the Taper phase and then phase three which people have a lot of trouble with is the rest phase. The day before your test, you should do nothing, you shouldn't study anything else, you shouldn't look at anything, it's all in there. You know you've been using the reinforcement techniques that promotes retention and understanding, you've Tapered through you're ready for the test, you know what it feels like, you know what it looks like, now is the time to chill out, you don't want to pull a muscle before getting in the ring, you also don't want to come in hung over, so don't take it too easy but the idea is try to do nothing and most people can't do nothing, so that rest day is a great day to go through those things that are going to be cramped, things like pediatric milestones or rheumatology, serology the diagnosis, the stuff that just doesn't stick, that's a good time to review those things. And so your study period, no matter how long it is and we'll talk more about that in the next section is going to consist of weeks of studying, you see at the end of Saturday and Sunday, the weekends and the Monday through Friday, Monday through Friday you're going to do the lessons and the lessons are going to be PACE. You get up in the morning you do the flash cards, from the videos two days ago and then you go through the lesson, prime, acquire, challenge one at a time, you're going to do that Monday to Friday. On the weekends, the goal is to read the quick tables. If you're fast you'll get through the whole thing in a weekend, if you're not that fast, you just keep reading from where you left off until the whole thing is read and you cycle through again, the idea is that you're ready, not just the quick tables but the notes you've added. As you approach test day things should get easier, this is test day, the day before test day is rest day and up to that point you've been Tapering, after test day, party or whatever. So, I want you to see, now this might be a little high level and the comparison to athletes may not make sense to everybody but I want you to see that we have designed OnlineMedEds with particularly to do the learning phase, that is the solidify the knowledge in a way that you're not going to forget it, you've learned it well, you've learned it correctly and you're going to remember. We also know that you need the prep for the test to actually train for the exam, not during the Taper phase, you're not going to learn anything new and you make sure you rest one day before, so no matter whether you're planning for a shelf which usually doesn't have much of a Taper phase or for the STEP exam, you can choose your schedule based on how grueling you want to make it and how long you want it to take. That is Education Phases of Learning.
