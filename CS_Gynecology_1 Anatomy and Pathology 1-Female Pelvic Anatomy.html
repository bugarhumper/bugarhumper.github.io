			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">This lesson assumes that you have completed the Reproduction collection in Preclinical Sciences, or at least have fully functional knowledge of pelvic anatomy. We first review the particularly useful information, then define a few terms (acknowledging that these terms have not always denoted what we define them here), and close by setting you up for success in the coming lessons. This lesson is heavily anatomical, with some clinical correlates sprinkled in. Even if you have a strong foundation in anatomy, you may find some of our approach foreign compared to other texts—pay attention in this one so that you aren’t distracted or confused by our methodology in subsequent lessons. </p>
			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Peritoneal Cavity and the Peritoneum</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">A woman is undergoing a laparoscopic unilateral salpingectomy. She is lying on her back on the operating table. Gravity pulls down, so in this position, gravity pulls the pelvic organs to the posterior of the pelvis. A trocar is inserted into the peritoneal cavity. To get into the peritoneal cavity, the operator passes a needle through the skin of the abdomen, through the superficial adipose tissue (the dermis and hypodermis), through the membranous layer, then the deep adipose tissue (present only above the abdominal muscles). The needle continues to penetrate the anterior rectus sheath, the abdominal muscles, and the posterior rectus sheath. Just before it reaches the lumen of the peritoneal cavity, the needle passes through the peritoneum, the mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity, which is the simple squamous epithelium of all Body Cavities. The term “Body Cavities” was coined by Dr. Williams and refers to all mesothelium-lined sacs of fluid. The peritoneal cavity is a Body Cavity. The only two things that should ever be within the peritoneal cavity are fluid and a surgeon (with the air and equipment needed to perform the surgery). The needle was used to enter the peritoneal cavity. A salpingectomy requires two ports, so the process is repeated once more—where exactly doesn’t matter for this discussion. We want you to have clarity on the peritoneal cavity first. There are two holes in the abdominal wall and now two ports accessing the peritoneal cavity. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US"><span class="Bold">Air is insufflated</span>; the belly distends as the peritoneal cavity swells. The air is necessary for the surgeon to do her work. Air rises, and because the patient is on her back, the air lifts the abdominal wall up and away from the visceral organs, which are pulled down (posteriorly) by gravity. The peritoneal cavity is lined with its mesothelium. Like all organs, that mesothelium has an adventitia composed of adipose and connective tissue, which it shares with the adjacent organ. <span class="Bold">The laparoscopic camera is inserted.</span> Imagine the camera in the middle of the peritoneal cavity in all planes. It is directly under where the umbilicus would be on the surface. Look up. The camera faces the <span class="Bold">anterior abdominal wall</span>. There is a sheen, a wetness to its appearance. Obvious blood vessels are zigging and zagging in all directions. The camera is in the peritoneal cavity. The blood vessels are above the peritoneum, farther away from the camera than the peritoneum is. Up means anterior to the patient. Up and anterior mean toward the abdominal wall. No viscera. That, therefore, is the <span class="Bold">parietal peritoneum</span>, the peritoneum that touches the abdominal wall, not the viscera.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Look down. Below the camera is the abdominal viscera. You can see the epiploic appendages of the colon or the omentum. The bowel does not adhere to itself—the bowel segments are easily separated from one another and can be moved independently. That is because they are separated from one another by the peritoneal cavity. Where the abdominal viscera touch the peritoneum is called the <span class="Bold">visceral peritoneum</span>. There is only <span class="Bold">one mesothelium</span>, the peritoneum, continuous with itself. Where it coats the anterior abdominal wall, it is parietal; where it coats the abdominal viscera, it is visceral. </p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The pelvis is no different. Move your mental camera from under the umbilicus to over the uterus. As you look upward, the anterior abdominal wall is above the uterus. Parietal peritoneum. Look down at the uterus. The uterus, uterine tubes, and rectum are beneath the peritoneum. You can introduce an instrument under (behind) the uterus and above (in front of) the rectum. The uterus can be lifted away from the rectum because there is no adventitia connecting them there. That is because the <span class="Bold">peritoneal cavity is in between</span>. The anterior uterus is coated with visceral peritoneum, the same visceral peritoneum coating the posterior uterus, which is the same visceral peritoneum coating the rectum. The instrument is in the peritoneal cavity. The uterus, rectum, and every other pelvic organ are on the other side of the peritoneum, <span class="Bold">under the peritoneum</span>.<span class="Bold"> </span>The peritoneum, the mesothelium lining the peritoneal cavity and coating the pelvic viscera, is a continuous sheet. </p>

In this analogy, the clothesline is the round ligament, and the sheet that hangs on either side is the broad ligament.

It contains areolar connective tissue and blood vessels, and the ureter is located under the medial leaflet on its way to the bladder.</p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Now, let’s take a tour of the pelvis. </p>
			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Pelvic Arteries</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The aorta splits into two common iliac arteries; we will follow one. The common iliac artery branches into the internal and external iliac arteries. The external iliac artery continues on to become the femoral artery, exiting the pelvis under the inguinal ligament and into the femoral triangle after giving rise to the inferior epigastric arteries, which are found in the lateral umbilical ligament, medial to the deep inguinal ring. The <span class="Bold">internal iliac artery</span> provides the majority of the blood supply to the organs within the pelvis. The internal iliac artery does not bifurcate, but rather it merely distributes branches. The <span class="Bold">superior gluteal </span>artery, the first branch of the internal iliac, is termed the <span class="Bold">posterior division </span>of the internal iliac artery. It leaves the pelvis and perfuses the skeletal muscle and nerves of the pelvic wall and gluteal compartment of the legs. It provides no visceral perfusion, so the posterior division will not be considered further. The <span class="Bold">anterior division </span>is merely the continuation of the internal iliac. The anterior division has some arteries that also leave the pelvis, so they won’t be considered in this discussion. The arteries that remain in the pelvis and perfuse the bladder, reproductive organs, and rectum are the <span class="Bold">superior vesicular </span>(bladder), the <span class="Bold">uterine </span>artery and its vaginal branch (cervix and upper third of the vagina), the <span class="Bold">middle rectal </span>artery (middle third of the vagina), and the <span class="Bold">internal pudendal </span>artery (distal third of the vagina). </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Independent of the internal iliac artery and its branches, the <span class="Bold">ovarian arteries </span>originate directly from the aorta. A product of the ovaries’ embryological origin (near each corresponding developing kidney), the gonadal artery begins as only a short vessel from the aorta. The ovaries descend (on the track laid out by the gubernaculum, just as the testes do), but they stop near the uterus, held in place by the gubernaculum-derived <span class="Bold">ovarian ligament</span>. Carried in the suspensory ligament of the ovary (also clinically called the infundibulopelvic ligament, or IP for short), the ovarian arteries originate from the aorta, quite far from the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries. Thus, there is an <span class="Bold">aortoiliac anastomosis </span>between the ovarian and uterine arteries, discussed below. </p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The pelvic floor is made of skeletal muscle. However, although skeletal muscle and its tendons contribute to the stability of the pelvis, the anterior, posterior, and sides of the pelvis are primarily formed by the pelvic bones. The <span class="Bold">sacrum and coccyx</span> are the posterior bones on the midline and part of the spine. The start of the sacral spine is also the superior border of the pelvis. On each side, the sacrum fuses with the <span class="Bold">iliac bone</span>s, the superior, long, and tall flat bones of the pelvic girdle. The iliac bones fuse at the hip joint, the acetabulum, with the <span class="Bold">pubic bone </span>anterior and the <span class="Bold">ischium </span>lateral and inferior. The two pubic bones connect through a cartilaginous joint called the <span class="Bold">pubic symphysis</span>. The inguinal ligament attaches the anterior iliac spine to the pubic bone.</p>

			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Pelvic Floor </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The “pelvic floor” or “pelvic diaphragm” is the bowl made of skeletal muscle and true orthopedic ligaments (bone to bone, rather than the misnomer ligaments in the abdomen and pelvis). The pelvic floor provides structure and mechanical support, holding everything in place, preventing the inferior displacement of the pelvic organs (sagging down, pulled by gravity). Both the <span class="Bold">pelvic floor muscles </span>and the <span class="Bold">pelvic floor ligaments </span>resist gravity. <span class="Bold">Estrogen supports ligaments.</span> As we will see in the next lesson, if ligaments start to sag (pelvic relaxation), the condition can be corrected with topical estrogen (strengthening the ligaments) or pelvic floor muscle training (strengthening the skeletal muscle).</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The most important components of the pelvic floor (those that provide the most critical support to the pelvic organs) are the <span class="Bold">levator ani muscle complex </span>(there is not a single levator ani muscle, but rather multiple muscles that make up the complex). The levator ani muscle complex comprises the <span class="Bold">pubococcygeus</span>, <span class="Bold">puborectalis</span>, and <span class="Bold">iliococcygeus</span> muscles. They are <span class="Bold">skeletal muscles</span> innervated by efferent somatic nerves arising from S2–S5 and are under somatic control. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The <span class="Bold">pubococcygeus muscle </span>is further divided into three segments: the pubovaginalis, the puboanalis, and the puboperinealis. They attach to the pubic bone anteriorly and curve around the structure they are named after (the vagina, the anus, and the perineal body, respectively). The puboanalis attaches to the anus between the internal and external sphincters. The pubovaginalis attaches to the lateral walls of the vagina, providing structural support to the vagina and urethra. The <span class="Bold">puborectalis muscle</span> is part of the anal sphincter complex. This muscle attaches to the pubic bone anteriorly and courses behind the anorectal junction. It contributes to fecal continence. The <span class="Bold">iliococcygeus muscle</span> attaches to the ischial spines anteriorly, the arcus tendinous fascia laterally, and the coccyx posteriorly. It creates a shelf on which the rectum, uterus, and proximal vagina rest. </p>

			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Organs and Relative Anatomy in the Pelvis</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The <span class="Bold">reproductive</span> <span class="Bold">organs </span>in the pelvis<span class="Bold"> </span>are the ovaries, uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina. Other related <span class="Bold">pelvic organs </span>are the bladder, urethra, rectum, and anus. It’s important to know both where they are in the pelvis and where they are in relation to each other. That is how a surgeon knows what not to cut and what to cut when looking at the peritoneum-lined structures. Remember, they are all on the other side of the peritoneum from the surgeon, and their proximity to each other and how much they crisscross increases the risk of dangerous errors (such as cutting the ureter instead of the uterosacral ligament). It also makes for excellent test questions. We’re going to detail the other organs one by one as we complete this lesson, but first, we want to establish the relative anatomy, the peritoneal spaces, and the interactions between the adventitia.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The <span class="Bold">bladder </span>is the most anterior organ in the pelvis—anterior to the bladder is the pubic symphysis (bone), and behind the bladder is the uterus. The <span class="Bold">urethra</span> exits the bladder from the trigone and courses anterior to the vagina, and the external urethral meatus reaches the outside of the body in the anterior fourchette—below the clitoris and above the vaginal introitus. Most of the bladder is not covered by peritoneum.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The uterus lies between the bladder and rectum. Several ligaments attach to the ovary. In the normal position, the fundus of the uterus is anterior, causing the anterior corpus to lie atop the bladder. The apex of the vagina and cervix (the most superior when the patient is standing) is the posterior fornix and uterine cervix, suspended from the sacrum by the uterosacral ligaments. The anterior vagina shares adventitia with the posterior urethra, and the posterior vagina shares adventitia with the anterior rectum. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The <span class="Bold">rectum </span>is the most <span class="Bold">posterior </span>pelvic visceral organ. It is continuous with the sigmoid colon from above and the anus below. The rectum has a lining of peritoneum that separates it from the posterior uterus, although it loses the peritoneum as it descends into the pelvis.</p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">A <span class="Bold">ureter</span> exits its kidney and travels down through the retroperitoneum, behind the peritoneum. It enters the pelvic brim medial to the suspensory ligament of the ovary (infundibulopelvic ligament) and lateral to the uterosacral ligament. The ureter crosses medially, under the transverse cervical ligament and uterine artery, to enter the trigone of the bladder. There is one ureter on each side. The mnemonic for the relationship between the uterine artery and the ureter is “water under the bridge,” where the water is the urine in the ureters, and the bridge is the transverse cervical ligament carrying the blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves over the ureter. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Where in contact with the mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity, organs are separated from one another by the peritoneal cavity’s fluid and mesothelium and the fat in its adventitia. When not in contact with the mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity, the organs are connected by adventitia, the loose connective tissue between organs through which blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves run. The rectum is connected to the posterior vagina by the rectovaginal adventitia, the cervix and superior bladder are connected by the vesicocervical adventitia, and the posterior bladder is connected to the anterior vagina by the vesicovaginal adventitia. As the urethra exits, the connective tissue fuses with the connective tissue of the distal vagina. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The <span class="Bold">vesicouterine pouch </span>(also known as the anterior cul-de-sac), a space where fluid can collect, is the peritoneum draped between the cervix of the uterus and the top of the bladder.

			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Ovaries</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The ovaries are small ellipsoid structures, each surrounded by a tunica albuginea, which causes them to appear white on visual inspection. The ovaries respond to the cycling hormones of the anterior pituitary, generating both follicles for eventual ovulation and the hormones that dictate the uterine cycle. During the follicular phase of the ovary, estrogen is made in response to FSH (new follicles) and LH (late follicles). Ovulation results in the silencing of the HPO axis by the progesterone-secreting corpus luteum in preparation for successful fertilization and implantation. The ovaries originate in the mesonephros, where the eventual mature kidneys begin their embryogenesis. Like the testes, the ovaries must descend from their position near the kidneys to their final position next to the uterus. Like the descent of the testes, the ovaries’ relocation is due more to the relative proliferation of other organs than to “migration.” However, there is an actual migration of each ovary down the track laid out for it by its gubernaculum. If Müllerian ducts are present during embryogenesis (these ducts become the uterine tubes, uterus, and upper third of the vagina), the gubernaculum will leave an anchor point on the track for the gonad as the gubernaculum goes to the deep inguinal ring to form the processus vaginalis. With a uterus present, the ovaries become anchored to the uterus and do not descend further to the deep inguinal ring. The connection between the uterus and ovary is the remnant of the gubernaculum’s path, the result of the anchor, called the <span class="Bold">ovarian ligament</span>. </p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">Because the ovaries originate in the middle of the body and migrate to the pelvis, they begin embryogenic life near the aorta. Thus, the <span class="Bold">ovarian arteries </span>are directly derived <span class="Bold">from the aorta</span>. This means that the blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves (all of which started connected to the ovary when it was in the middle of the abdomen) must also reach the ovary from their origins. These structures are carried within the <span class="Bold">suspensory ligament of the ovary </span>(also called the infundibulopelvic ligament, or IP). The blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves of the ovary anastomose with the uterine arteries and perfuse the ovary, uterine tube, and uterine fundus. <span class="Bold">Venous drainage </span>mirrors that of the adrenal, renal, and testicular veins. Because the inferior vena cava (IVC) is on the right side of the body, the adrenal, renal, and ovarian veins <span class="Bold">on the right drain</span> <span class="Bold">directly into the IVC</span>. In contrast, the adrenal, renal, and ovarian veins <span class="Bold">on the left</span> <span class="Bold">drain to a common renal vein </span>before draining into the IVC. </p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The uterine tubes are technically part of the uterus, although they are conventionally associated with the ovaries. Together, the uterine tube, ovary, and their associated peritoneum (broad ligament) are called the <span class="Bold">adnexa</span>. Historically, this association has made it difficult to clearly distinguish the uterine cancers on the ovary and is why those cancers, despite having the phenotype, epithelium, and genetics of uterine cancers, are still called “epithelial ovarian tumors.” The ovaries are derived from entirely different tissue and embryological origin from the uterine tubes, which are derived from the Müllerian ducts, which is also the embryological origin of the uterus, cervix, and upper third of the vagina. </p>
			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">Uterus</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The <span class="Bold">uterus </span>is central in the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum. The uterus is divided into the fundus (the top), the corpus (the body), and the cervix (the neck, exit). The uterus communicates with the vagina through its lower, fibrous portion known as the cervix, which sits at an angle to the vagina (the “angle of version”). In many patients, the uterus is <span class="Bold">anteverted</span>, meaning that the uterus has a forward tilt over the bladder. This means that the most posterior of the reproductive organs is actually the posterior fornix of the vagina (see below). The cervix contains mostly collagen with little smooth muscle, and the endocervical epithelium is not proliferative like the rest of the endometrium. The cervix connects to the muscular uterine <span class="Bold">corpus </span>at the <span class="Bold">isthmus</span>. The isthmus marks the start of the <span class="Bold">uterine cavity </span>and the end of the <span class="Bold">endocervical canal</span>. In the uterus, the <span class="Bold">uterine tubes</span> insert bilaterally at the cornua. The portion of the uterus superior to these entry points is known as the uterine <span class="Bold">fundus</span>. The <span class="Bold">endometrium</span> is the inner mucosal lining of the uterus. This part of the uterus proliferates and sheds in response to hormonal changes of the ovarian cycle (commonly and erroneously called the menstrual cycle). The <span class="Bold">myometrium</span> is a thick muscular layer surrounding the endometrium. The peritoneum that drapes over the uterus is called a serosal layer, but you know that it is really just the adventitia of the uterus and the adventitia of the peritoneal cavity.</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The uterus is tethered to the ovary by the <span class="Bold">ovarian ligament</span>, a fibrous, gubernaculum-derived structure that keeps the fimbriated end of the uterine tube close to the ovary. The <span class="Bold">round ligament</span>, also a gubernaculum-derived structure, connects the fundus of the uterus to the deep inguinal ring. These provide no support for the uterus. There are effectively three ligaments (on each side) that keep the uterine cervix fixed in place. The <span class="Bold">transverse cervical ligament </span>(also called the cardinal ligament) connects the cervix to the posterolateral pelvic sidewall, near where the uterine artery originates from the internal iliac. The transverse cervical ligament helps sustain the uterus in the left-right plane. The transverse cervical ligament also carries the blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves to the lateral cervix. The <span class="Bold">uterosacral ligament </span>(from the uterus back toward the posterior pelvic sidewall) and, to a lesser extent, the <span class="Bold">pubocervical ligament</span> (multiple collective anterior ligaments supporting the bladder and uterus to the anterior pelvic wall) affix the cervical in the anterior-posterior plane. </p>

			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The vagina is a hollow tube lined with nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelium. Its distal end is below the pelvic floor and, therefore, compressed. Its proximal end is above the pelvic floor and more distensible. The cervix enters the vagina at an angle, creating the <span class="Bold">fornix</span> around the cervix. Although there is only one fornix, it is usually delineated into the anterior (bladder), posterior (rectum), and left and right fornices. The vascular supply comes from the <span class="Bold">vaginal artery</span>, perfusing the upper third of the vagina and carried in the transverse cervical ligament. The vagina has other branches of the internal iliac artery—the <span class="Bold">inferior rectal</span> artery perfuses the middle third, and the <span class="Bold">internal pudendal </span>perfuses the distal third. The vagina exits from the vaginal vestibule beneath the urethra. </p>
			<p class="Headers_Major-Section-Title" lang="en-US">External Genitalia</p>
			<p class="Body_Lead---Mid-Paragraph" lang="en-US">The fat pad anterior to the pubic bones is called the <span class="Bold">mons pubis </span>and is continuous with the two <span class="Bold">labia majora</span>. The mons and the labia majora are covered with hair-bearing skin post puberty. They cover the two <span class="Bold">labia minora</span>, thin mucocutaneous structures that meet at the perineum in the posterior and merge to form the <span class="Bold">fourchette</span>, just below the glans clitoris, connecting to the internal structures of the clitoris. The <span class="Bold">glans</span> <span class="Bold">clitoris</span>, covered by the <span class="Bold">prepuce</span> (foreskin), is the only externally visible structure of the much larger clitoris. The glans clitoris, analogous to the glans penis and its foreskin, is just the tip of the clitoris, the organ. Just as in the male penis, the female clitoris has two bulbourethral glands and two corpora cavernosa, complete with helicine arteries that enable engorgement and erection. </p>
